1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT
                                                                 
                                                                 
The 1633 EA Acoustic Electronics Cartridge is a single-conductor
electronics cartridge responsible for the data acquisition,
downhole analysis, and telemetry interface for the 1421 XA Micro
CBL or the 1424 XA Segmented Bond Tool.
The 3504 communications protocol specifications govern the
telemetry interface with the surface system and are briefly
summarized in DATA ACQUISITION, document component 130363-995.*  
The 1633 EA cartridge--attached to the top of the SBT or Micro CBL
acoustic mandrel--controls and receives signals from the mandrel. 
Acquired data from the 1633 EA is sent to the surface at a rate of
20.8 kbits/s.  Acquisition tables dictate the way in which the
data is acquired for a given request from the surface system.
Acoustic data is acquired simultaneously from two receivers. 
This is accomplished by the two-channel 8-bit A/D card under the
control of the CPU card, both of which are located in the flasked
electronics section of the 1633 EA cartridge.  
Figure 935-1 shows the major components of the 1633 EA.
During an acquisition sequence, the acoustic mandrel is
configured to select a transmitter, two receivers, and gains
based on the acquisition table.  Control of the mandrel is
accomplished through a serial communication link.

1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION 

POWER SUPPLY ASSEMBLY
Refer to schematic C149266-100.
The power supply assembly provides regulated +15 V, -15 V, and +5 V
for the 1633 EA cartridge as well as for the mandrel.*
The 150-VDC cablehead supply comes down on conductor 7 and is
taken off the Flask Connector Board C143328 on terminal T18.  The
150 VDC is routed to a filter network on the power supply
assembly consisting of L1, C12, R6, and C11 which drops the
voltage down to approximately 140 VDC.
The voltage is then routed through a negative voltage protector
diode (D13) to the 160-V regulator circuit.  This circuit,
comprised of Q3, Q4, R5, C10, and D14, provides over-voltage
protection.  The maximum voltage seen on the output of the
regulator is approximately 157 VDC, but under normal operation is
approximately 135 VDC.
This voltage is applied to the primary of the self-oscillating
power supply.  There an imbalance bias voltage is set through R4
that turns on first Q1.  Feedback windings then provide the
continual switching for Q1 and Q2 necessary to sustain
oscillation.
One secondary winding of T1 provides an output that is rectified
(by bridge D1, D2, D3, D4) to supply approximately +24.5 VDC and
-24.5 VDC to the input of the +15 V and -15 V regulators,
respectively.  The other secondary winding provides an output
that is rectified (by bridge D5, D8) to supply approximately +13
VDC to the input of the +5 V regulator.
The output for all the micropac regulators (+15 V, -15 V, +5 V)
should be within 1% of the nominal output voltage.  The inputs to
these regulators are filtered by 82-microfarad caps (C1, C3, C4).
The regulator output is filtered by 1-microfarad caps (C5, C7,
C8).
The 1633 EA will draw approximately 85-90 mA from the surface
power supply when not connected to the mandrel.
*
Mandrel refers to the 1424 XA or 1421 XA instrument that is
run with the 1633 EA.
NOTE:
Early production tools contained additional components to
support a - 5 Vdc power supply.  These have been removed

2.2.2

SINGLE-CONDUCTOR TRANSCEIVER CARD B142767
Refer to schematic C142767-100.
The Single-Conductor Transceiver Card is responsible for the
reception and transmission of Manchester data on the wireline.
As a single conductor instrument, the 1633 EA communication
signals ride on the 150-VDC cablehead voltage.  The 150 VDC comes
in on conductor 7, referenced to 10, at the top of the 1633 EA and
is routed to both the power supply filter and the Single-
Conductor Card (at P4-14).
2.2.1
RECEIVER SECTION
Data sent down to the 1633 EA is coupled off the incoming 150 VDC
on P4-14 by C1 into the first stage of the receiver section.  The
first stage of amplification (1/2 U1) has gain adjustment (R28
and R3) which can be adjusted accordingly for given line
conditions.  (Refer to REPAIR/MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE, document
130364-956.)
The signal is then coupled by C7 to the second stage (1/2 U1) and
by C10 to the third stage (1/2 U2), with each stage having a
fixed gain.
The other half of U2 acts in the last stage as a comparator which
is switched by the received signal that provides the logic level
necessary for the Unipolar Data In (UDI) to the Manchester chip
on the CPU Board.  The UDI signal is routed from the Single-
Conductor Board at P4-6.
2.2.2
TRANSMITTER SECTION
When transmitting data back to the surface system, a Bipolar Zero
Out (BZO) signal from the Manchester chip on the CPU Board

C143318 is routed to the Single-Conductor Card via P4-3.  This
signal provides the switching logic to the hex FET U3.
The output driving FET's of U3--tied to R25 and R26--switch the
+15-V drive voltage to ground and to +15 V, depending on the
transmitted data bits. This signal is coupled to the 150-VDC line

2.3.2

RUC INTERFACE BOARD C154459
The RUC Interface board acts as a conduit for information from
other instruments in the logging string to the CPU in the 1633 EA.
Four Remote Unit Controller (RUC) chips on the board store
accumulated data from the 1309 XA GR and the 2420 XA (or 2435 XA)
Neutron instruments until the CPU is able to retrieve the data,
process the information, and transmit it uphole.  In addition,
the cable head voltage and the CCL signal from the 2330 XA or
2346 XA instrument are routed through the RUC Interface board.
Note
The RUC chip is a custom-designed
integrated circuit developed by
Western Atlas.  A detailed breakdown
of the internal circuitry may be
found in any one of the maintenance
manuals for the 8000 series PCM
Production Logging tools.  Only a
generalized description of the chip's
function will appear here.
2.3.1
GR AND NEUTRON DATA
Tool measurement data (GR, SSN, and LSN signals) enter the RUC
Interface board on the appropriate pin at J1.  (See schematic
C154459-100.)  Each signal is routed through a 1-kilohm resistor
and a Schmitt trigger inverter (IC-5) which converts the signal
to a square wave and improves noise immunity.  The output from
the Schmitt trigger feeds into the RUC 16-bit counter at pin 2
(of IC2, IC3, or IC4) where tool measurement data accumulates.
Each RUC chip has a unique address strapped to pins 9 through 13.
By means of an 8-bit address/command byte that is composed of a
5-bit address and a 3-bit command, the CPU (IC-1 on CPU board

1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
2.3.1
GR AND NEUTRON DATA (CONTINUED)
To issue an address/command byte to the RUC chips, the CPU places
a high on the RCMD line (J1-3) and sends the address/command byte
to pin 14 of each RUC via the RDTA line (J1-5).  Eight pulses on
the RCLK line (J1-3) from the CPU ensure that the byte is clocked
into each RUC, after which the RCMD line goes low.  Figure 945-2
shows the signal path of each line from the RUC Interface board
to the CPU board.
The RUC whose address strapping (on pins 9-13) matches the 5-bit
address in the address/command byte is the RUC that responds to
the CPU's request for data.  The internal 16-bit counter on the
RUC is reset after the low-order bits have been loaded into the
register.  The internal counter than continues to accumulate data
counts for the next data request.
Upon receiving a READ command from the CPU, the RUC loads its
data into the RUC 8-bit shift register.  The 8 high-order bits
are loaded first followed by the 8 low-order bits.  The CPU sends
17 clock pulses down the RCLK line to clock data out RUC pin 14,
over the RDAT line, and to the CPU for processing.
The RUC counter remains empty until the next address/command byte
is clocked into RUC pin 14, at which time the counter begins to
accumulate tool measurement data again.
2.3.2
CCL DETECTION CIRCUIT
To compensate for various CCL magnet strengths as well as varying
casing sizes, R1 is used to adjust CCL signal amplitudes coming
into the RUC interface board at J1-13.  The CCL signal is then
converted to a unipolar signal by full-wave active rectifier IC7.
In the next stage, IC8--with a fixed gain of 3--amplifies the CCL
signal before it is sent to the CPU board.
The CCL signal is multiplexed by IC9 with cablehead voltage and
routed from the RUC interface board via J1-14 to the CPU board
where it is converted by the on-board A/D on the microcontroller.
The A/D is a 10-bit converter but is used only as a 9-bit
converter (0 min to 511 max).
The CCL signal is sampled each subcycle in an acquisition
sequence.  These values are averaged to yield a composite value
that is included in the data package sent to the surface.
Cablehead voltage is divided down by R5/R6 and routed through IC6
to IC9, where it is multiplexed with the CCL signal and then
routed from the RUC interface board via J1-14.  Tool software
controls the output of IC1, which controls the multiplexer
selection of CCL or cablehead voltage.

CONNECTOR DISTRIBUTION BOARD B143320
Refer to schematic C143320-100 or to drawing D151202.
This board serves as a distribution center for the I/O Bus as
well as a channel for signals entering and leaving the flasked
electronics.  Three I/O Bus inlets--avaliable through CJ2, CJ5,
and CJ6--allow peripheral devices to be tied to the 20-conductor
I/O Bus.
The two-channel 8-bit A/D Card D142762 is connected (via P2 on
the A/D board) to the Distribution Board at CJ5.
Connector J1 on the CPU Board is tied to the Distribution Board
at CJ3 and CJ4.
Power supplies, grounds, and communications and auxiliary signals
which must extend outside the flasked electronics are routed
through CJ1.

8-BIT A/D BOARD D142762
Refer to schematic D142762-100.
The 8-Bit A/D Board has two channels that allow simultaneous
conversions of two receive signals, and an I/O Interface Bus that
provides data transfer to the CPU Board.  The following
description given for channel 1 is identical in operation to the
second channel (shown on the bottom half of schematic D142762-
100).
The selected bipolar receive signal enters the 8-Bit A/D Card via
terminal T1 (referenced to T2) at the input of operational
amplifier IC1 which has unity gain.  A resistor network (R3-R9
and R41) allows varying amounts of signal attenuation to be
selected by 8-to-1 multiplexer IC2, which is under the control of
the latched bits of IC10.  The signal output of the multiplexer
is routed to IC3 which has a fixed gain of 2.
The signal output of IC3 rides on the 2.5-V reference voltage of
IC23 to provide the necessary offset voltage for the A/D system
which requires unipolar data to the input of the A/D (IC5).  This
unipolar data is provided via the output of IC4 to the input of
the A/D (IC5-28).

8-BIT A/D BOARD D142762  (CONTINUED)
The A/D +ref (IC5-17) is supplied by IC6 (typically 5.05 V) and
the -ref (IC5-27) is tied to ground.  During an acquisition
cycle, conversion clocks (IC5-1) are provided to the A/D via the
I/O Bus from the CPU Board.  Figure 945-3 shows a timing diagram
for the A/D.
The conversion clock present at the A/D (IC5-1) consists of
31.25-ns wide low-level pulses at a frequency determined by the
sample rate set in the data acquisition table.  The 31.25-ns
pulse provides the data conversion, and the remainder of the
clock cycle (period) writes converted data into the 4 K X 9 FIFO
(IC9).  The number of conversion pulses for a given subcycle
(again refer to DATA ACQUISITION) is dictated by the data
acquisition table.
An I/O Bus--consisting of a 4-bit address bus, 8-bit data bus,
I/O line, and conversion clock--allows the A/D to interface with
the CPU Board.  (See Section 3.3.4 for more detail on the I/O
Bus.)
One half of IC7 provides decoding for the selected channel, while
the second half of IC7 handles decoding for the specific device
on the selected channel.
Status information such as Empty Flag (IC9-21), Full Flag (IC9-
8), and gain settings can be read from the A/D board through the
buffer IC8.
An onboard control latch (IC10) controls devices on its
associated channel such as the variable attenuation (IC2), FIFO
Reset (IC9-22), and FIFO Retransmit (IC9-23).
The conversion clock is inverted and buffered by IC20 to provide
the necessary drive and logic for the A/D (IC5-1) and FIFO Write

COMMUNICATION INTERFACE
Communication is handled through an interrupt-driven system.  The

Kbits/second) for receiving and transmitting.  The 6408 is
comprised of a Decoder and Encoder as described in the following
sections.
DECODER SECTION
---------------
A dual binary counter (IC20) divides down a 16-MHz base
oscillator (IC28) to provide the 250-kHz source clock to the
decoder clock input (IC11-5).  Data is received serially through
the buffer-protected UDI input of the 6408 (IC11-8) which
monitors the data for a valid sync pattern.
Once a valid sync pattern is recognized, the take data output
(IC11-3) goes high, and if the sync pattern is that of a command
type the command data sync line (IC11-10) will also go high.  The
falling edge of the take data and command sync lines causes a
corresponding interrupt to be triggered through the flip-flop
(IC19, pin 5 & 1).
If the word received is of a data type, the flip-flop output
(IC19-9) set by take data will be the only interrupt set which is
then responded to by the microcontroller.  If the word received
is of a command type, then both outputs of the flip-flop (IC19-
9&12) are set and the microcontroller--handling the interrupts on
a priority basis--recognizes the word received as a command.
The microcontroller responds to a data-received interrupt
(command or data type) by reading the word from the parallel
outputs of the shift registers (IC14 & IC13). The interrupts
generated by a word being received are cleared when the reset
lines (IC19-6&2) are pulled low for the duration of the READ
cycle on the low byte of the word received (stored in IC14).

1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
3.3.3
COMMUNICATION INTERFACE  (CONTINUED)
ENCODER SECTION
---------------
The base 16-MHz oscillator (IC28) is divided down through the
dual binary counter (IC20) and the encoder clock (IC11-23) is
selected (by jumper X to Y) to deliver a 250-kHz clock.
The encoder is enabled when the microcontroller (IC1) sets a
control latch bit (IC27-2) high, which is gated with the system
reset (IC31-3).  This gating is required to keep the T2 mode
encoder disabled until the microcontroller has properly
initialized setups upon power up.
The 6408 encoder shift clock (IC11-2) is gated with the encoder
of the 6409 (IC12)--which is not used in the 1633 EA--to provide a
shift clock output on IC32-11.  When the encoder is enabled, the
bit counter IC17 will be clocked.
Note
The 6409 (IC12) is only used on the 1667 EA
for high-speed data transmission to the
surface.
Before the encoder is enabled for a data transmission, the
buffered parallel-to-serial shift registers (IC16 & IC15) are
loaded with the first two words (16 BIT) to send to the surface.
The shift registers have a buffered latched input which allows
the word being sent to be loaded, as well as the word following.
A control latch bit (IC27-4) must be set low when the first word
is loaded into the shift registers (IC16 & IC15) to allow the
word to be transferred to the output latches of the shift
register.  The control latch bit is then set high and the second
word is loaded into the input buffer of the shift registers.

1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
3.3.3
COMMUNICATION INTERFACE  (CONTINUED)
ENCODER SECTION  (Cont'd)
-------------------------
When the encoder is disabled, the output of gate IC32-3 holds the
bit counter (IC17) in a load mode and the word boundary indicator
(IC18) in a reset mode.  Enabling the encoder causes the bit
counter to be incremented by the gated encoder shift clock (IC32-
11).
When the 16th bit has been clocked, the falling edge of the bit
counter (IC17-7) causes the word boundary indicator (IC18-8) to
go low, which causes the following events to occur:
1)
A low output on IC18-8 results in a low-level output on
IC31-11 which loads in the next word from the input-to-
output buffers on IC16 & IC15.
2)
The falling edge of IC18-8 generates an encoder
interrupt, causing a high level on IC18-12 which is
recognized on the NMI (IC1-7) input of the
microcontroller.  This interrupt prompts the
microcontroller to load the next word of the transmission
block into the input buffers of the shift registers (IC16
& IC15).  When the low byte of the word is loaded (WRITE
to IC16-12), the encoder interrupt (IC18-12) is disabled
by the reset line (IC18-2) being pulled low for the
duration of the WRITE cycle.
3)
The low output of the word boundary indicator (IC18-8)
also resets the indicator and the bit counter by pulling
low the indicator's reset line (IC18-6) and the bit
counter's load line (IC17-11).  The bit counter is
reloaded with a value of zero before the next word is
shifted.
The above process occurs for each word transmitted to the surface
until the last word of the data block is transmitted.  Due to the
double buffering in the shift registers (IC16 & IC15), it is

3.3.4
I/O Bus
A universal 20-conductor bus allows the CPU to access data from
peripheral boards tied to the bus.  This 20-conductor I/O bus is
made available to peripheral boards through a Connector
Distribution Board (B143320) connected to the CPU Board.  See
Section 3.1 for a description of the Connector Distribution
Board.
Below are the bus specifications:
-
An I/O control line (IC41-11) which enables the decoding
logic on each board connected to the bus
-
A 4-bit address bus (IC41, pins 2,4,6, and 8) which uses the
upper two bits (AD3 and AD2) to decode the particular board
and the lower two bits (AD1 and AD0) to decode the specific
device on the addressed board
-
An 8-bit data bus (IC40, pins 2 through 9) which serves as a
bi-directional path for data transfer
-
A conversion clock (IC41-13) which is available for the A/D
modules connected to the bus but is active only during an
acquisition cycle
-
Power supplies and grounds:  +15 V, -15 V, +5 V, DGND, and
AGND.

The 8-bit, bi-directional data bus is buffered through an octal
transceiver (IC40).  The 4-bit address bus is buffered by one
half of an octal buffer (IC41), with the I/O control line and
conversion clock buffered in the other half.

1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
3.3.5
A/D CONTROL
The sample rate for A/D modules is programmable from 62.5 kHz to
8 MHz, and the number of samples accumulated is programmable from
1 to 4095.  The variable sample rate is achieved by dividing down
a 16-MHz base clock (IC28) (via cascaded binary counters IC25 and
IC26) with a value stored in a latch (IC21).  Due to timing
synchronization, the base clock frequency is always divided down
by one more than the value stored in the latch (IC21).
to zero from the value stored in the latch, a borrow is generated
(IC26-13) which clocks flip-flop IC30.  The high out on IC30-12
is the high period of the conversion clock and is gated with the
base 16-MHz clock to allow a 31.25-ns high pulse before resetting
IC30.  At the same time IC30-13 is low, which reloads the
cascaded counters (IC25 and IC26) with their original count value
to restart the process.
This process goes on continually, with the high state of the
continuous clock IC30-12 at a fixed period of 31.25 ns but with
the low state varying based on sample rate.  (This non-
symmetrical duty cycle is necessary to meet A/D module and FIFO
set-up specs.)
The continuous conversion clock IC30-12 is present at the
synchronization flip-flop IC29-5.  Therefore, as soon as a source
fire sync (IC29-1) is issued by the microcontroller (IC1-46) to
initiate the start of an acquisition cycle, the conversion clock
is immediately enabled (IC29-9).
This rising edge fire sync (IC29-9) is sent to the mandrel to
fire the transmitter, as well as to enable the A/D converter
clock (IC31-8).  The fire sync is routed through a level
translator (IC6-3) where it is sent to the mandrel at a 15-volt
level (IC6-4).
Once the converter clock is enabled (IC3-8), it decrements the
sample counters (cascaded binary counters IC22, IC23, IC24)
which--when decremented to zero (end of sample accumulation)--
cause a borrow (IC24-13) that disables the A/D conversion clock.
These sample counters are loaded with the number of samples to
accumulate (1 to 4095) prior to each transmitter firing
(acquisition cycle).  The converter clock is buffered by IC41
where it is available on the I/O bus.

1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
3.3.6
SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS
The CPU Board has two serial communication interfaces with
external peripheral devices.  Each uses three lines to control
the transfer of data.
MANDREL COMMUNICATION INTERFACE
-------------------------------
The 1633 EA uses one of these serial interfaces for the control of
transmitter, receiver, and gain selections in the mandrel.  The
lines for this interface are summarized below:
R/W ----- (IC1-47 P1.6) ----- Controls direction of data
transfer (i.e., send or
receive).
DATA ---- (IC1-48 P1.5) ----- Serial data transmission line.
Provides serial data out.
(IC1-6  P0.3) ----- Serial data transmission line.
Receives serial data.
CLOCK --- (IC1-55 P1.4) ----- Clocks data into and from
remote serial devices at
approximately 100 kHz.  Data
is shifted on the rising edge.
The above lines are routed through a level translator (IC6)
that steps up signals leaving the CPU Board to +15 V.
Incoming serial data is routed through a step-down
translator (IC39), with the serial R/W line controlling
which translator is enabled.  A set- up sequence is executed
before each acquisition which consists of setting the
correct receiver, transmitter, and gain selections.
AUXILIARY DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE
--------------------------------------
The 1633 EA uses the other serial interface to read auxiliary data
(e.g., GR, N, or CN) from the RUC Interface Board C143319.
RCMD -----(IC1-57 P1.2) ----- This line serves as a command
control or R/W line.
RDAT ---- (IC1-58 P1.1) ----- This is a bi-directional
serial data transmission line.
RCLK ---
(IC1-59 P1.0) ----- Clocks serial data into or
from remote serial devices at
approximately 100 kHz."

1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- MECHANICAL DESCRIPTION 
 
Refer to drawing R152302. 
 
The 1633 EA is housed in a 3.38-inch O.D. housing with an I.D. of 2.75 inches and a length of 
84 inches.  
 
 
The top sub has standard 3.38-inch WTS threads (AP-108) which mate with the housing, and 
standard 3.38-inch (AP-43) outer threads which mate to the standard Western Atlas cablehead. 
The bottom sub is a standard 3.38-inch WTS joint.  
 
The top sub allows 0.30 inch of thermal expansion for the enclosed electronics. A vacuum flask 
2.5 inches O.D. by 42 inches long houses the CPU, Distribution, and Two-Channel 8-bit A/D 
boards. The heat sink contains 10 pounds of Cerrobend alloy to absorb heat and slow the 
heating process.  
 
Install a “dummy” flask (P/N F197172000) as required, where the temperature difference 
between the borehole environment and the electronics rating of less than 257°F (125°C) will 
allow advantageous heat transfer and dissipation to the borehole. 
 
Both the external and internal electronics are supported by an H-beam type chassis.

diagnostics.  These programs can be used to either verify
the operation of the instrument, or as an aid in adjusting
the system.  See PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE LEVEL 3 (component -
953) or REPAIR/MAINTENANCE (component -956).
Reset Tool -- Sends the command 0 to the instrument which
tells tool to initialize itself to power-up state.
Read Instrument Version -- Diagnostic command that reads the
version of firmware installed in the instrument.  The
received data is displayed on the CRT.
Transmit STCW -- User may transmit any of the 3504 tool
commands. User is prompted for the tool command word.
For example, if the user wants to open the SBT pads, he
enters 5 (HEX).  User is then requested to enter data
(0-4095).  To open the pads, the data is 2.*
Acquire Data Dump -- Diagnostic command that allows the user
to view the actual raw data transmitted to the surface.
Raw data from the tool scrolls across the screen.
Acquire Signature Dump -- Diagnostic command that allows the
user to view the transmitter code, receiver code, gain
code, sample period, and start time from the SEND
SUBCYCLE SIGNATURES TO SURFACE command (Command 8).
The actual wave data can be viewed in the EGA Waveform
Display Menu.

INSTRUMENT DIAGNOSTICS (CONTINUED)
Communication Test -- Allows the user to verify the
telemetry system.  Two different tests are available--
ECHO WORD and INCREMENT.  Each test transmits 2048-word
blocks to the instrument and compares the data echoed
from the instrument to verify the communication.
ECHO WORD
The PC prompts the user for a Word to
echo to the instrument.  Data is entered
in HEX.  The test continues until it is
aborted by pressing <ESC>.
INCREMENT
The PC sequences through all possible
bit patterns.  The test ends after all
patterns have been transmitted and
received.
The communication test is continuously monitored on the
CRT.  Errors can be printed out after the test is
completed or aborted.
The CONTINUOUS TRANSMIT MODE is used to set up the
telemetry to the instrument or to continuously repeat a
command.
The user must enter a word to ECHO, the type of sync:
data/command, and the delay between transmissions.
The program will continuously send this word until the
program is aborted with the <ESC> key."

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE/EQUIPMENT -- 1668 MA MULTIPOLE ARRAY ACOUSTILOG 
INTRODUCTION
The Multipole Array Acoustilog Instrument (MAC) integrates a conventional monopole acoustic
array with a dipole acoustic array.  The arrays are independent, with separate compressional and
shear transducers optimized for each array.  The MAC is a WTS instrument and must operate in
conjunction with the 1667 EA Acoustics Electronics Cartridge and the 3510 XA WTS Common
Remote.
The MAC consists of four major components: Receiver Mandrel, Acoustic Isolator, Transmitter
Mandrel and Transmitter Electronics.

1668 MA RECEIVER MANDREL
The 1668 MA includes the pressure compensated receiver section and the receiver electronics of
the Multipole Array Acoustilog Instrument.  It is 3-5/8 inches in diameter and can be run at
400 F and 20,000 psi.
o
The receiver section of the mandrel contains an array of eight dipole and an array of eight
monopole piezoelectric receiver crystals.  The monopole transducers are conventional
piezoelectric cylinders with a broadband response from 1-20 kHz.  The dipole array's
transducers are gradient hydrophones of the flexural disk type, optimized for the 0.5-5 kHz
band.  The flexural disk design inherently provides good common mode (P-wave) rejection.
In the standard In-Line configuration (8x8), the dipole receivers are all lined up on the same
axis.  The dipole receiver modules are designed such that, after pulling the sleeve, every other
shear receiver can be rotated 90  to provide a 2-axis-dipole/monopole (4x4x8) configuration.
o
The arrays are physically interleaved so the spacing between similar transducers is 6 inches.
Hence, in the standard 8x8 configuration, both arrays have 6 inch spacings, but in the 4x4x8
configuration, each of the 2-axis dipole arrays has 12 inch spacings.  The 8x8 and 4x4x8
configurations are illustrated on the MAC System diagram found behind the Equipment
Information tab.
The receiver electronics section, which is above the receiver section, is an integral part of the
mandrel.  The signals generated by the receivers pass into the mandrel through a 67 pin
bulkhead connection, which is not intended to be a field joint.  The purpose of the receiver
electronics is to amplify, filter and multiplex the signals, under control of the 1667 EA Acoustic
Electronics Cartridge.  The bandwidth of the receiver electronics is software controlled to select
one each of 3 high and 3 low cutoff frequencies.  The high frequency cutoff serves as the anti-
aliasing filter for the analog to digital converters.  Signal selection and the Automatic Gain
Control (AGC), is governed by the acoustic serial channel."
1668MA-MAC-AMO,Brief Description of Service - BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE/EQUIPMENT -- 1668MA MULTIPOLE ARRAY ACOUSTILOG,"2
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE/EQUIPMENT -- 1668 MA MULTIPOLE ARRAY ACOUSTILOG

1668 PA ACOUSTIC ISOLATOR
The acoustic isolator has no active components.  The purpose of this section is to attenuate and
delay the direct tool arrival (sound that is propagated along the tool body).  This device is a rigid
clamshell structure of proprietary design.
In all configurations of the 1668 XA MAC system, the acoustic isolator must be run between the
transmitter and receiver mandrels.  This instrument may also be used in the 1670 XA DAC
system to increase the transmitter to receiver spacing.
The isolator is pressure compensated with silicon oil and has standard WTS joints on top and
bottom.  It is 3e inches in diameter and may be run at 400 EF and 20,000 psi.
NOTE
The Acoustic Isolator is a fairly flexible instrument and will buckle in
compression.  Buckling failure will occur if the bending deflection of the isolator
is not constrained and an excessive compressive load is applied.

1668 BA TRANSMITTER MANDREL
The transmitter mandrel houses two monopole transmitters, two dipole transmitters and four
high voltage pulse transformers.  The purpose of this section is to produce broadband acoustic
pluses, either compressional or shear, upon receipt of fire pulses from the 1668 FA transmitter
electronics.
The transmitter mandrel may be configured in two ways.  The dipole transmitters may be align
forming a completely redundant system; or, the dipole transmitters may be orthogonal, oriented
at 90 E to each other.  The in-line transmitter configuration corresponds to the 8 X8, single axis,
receiver configuration.  The 2-axis dipole configuration corresponds to the 4 X4 X8 receiver
configuration.
NOTE
The MAC System can be set up to run in either an in-line (8 X) or 2-axis (4 X4)
configuration.  The in-line configuration is suggested for most cases.  If the
1668 MA receiver mandrel is configured in-line, the 1668 BA mandrel must be
run with the dipole transmitters aligned (i.e., the ""Dipole Orientation"" at ""- 0 -E""
).  If the 1668 MA receiver mandrel is configured in the 2-axis dipole mode, the
1668 BA mandrel must be run with the dipole transmitters orthogonal (i.e., the
""Dipole Orientation"" at ""- 90 -E"" ).
The transmitter mandrel is pressure compensated with silicon oil and has standard WTS joints
on top and bottom.  It is 3e inches in diameter and can be run at 400 EF and 20,000 psi."

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE/EQUIPMENT -- 1668 MA MULTIPOLE ARRAY ACOUSTILOG

1668 FA TRANSMITTER ELECTRONICS
The transmitter electronics includes the high voltage pulse circuitry and the serial channel
interface.  The purpose of this section is to provide electrical fire pulses to the transmitter
mandrel on command from the surface.  It is 3d"" in diameter and may be run at 400 EF and
20,000 psi.
NOTE
The 1668 FA must be run in conjunction with/below the
1668 BA MAC Transmitter Mandrel.  It may also be run
with/below the 1670 BA DAC Transmitter Mandrel as a
replacedment for the 1670 FA.  All further technical
details are contained in the 1668 FA Manual, P/N 130492-
915.

1667 EA ACOUSTIC COMMON
The Multipole Acoustic tool operates in conjunction with the 1667 EA Acoustics Electronics
Cartridge and the 3510 Telemetry Repeater.  The acoustic common contains the low voltage
power supply, WTS Instrument Bus Interface, 4 channel simultaneous 12 bit A/D converters, 12
MHz CPU, 64 Kbytes RAM, 32 Kbytes EPROM, I/O Bus Interface and the acoustic serial
channel interface.  The purpose of this section is to provide timing and control for the
transmitter and receiver mandrels, to digitize the received acoustic waves, to analyze the
acquired waveforms and to transmit data to the WTS repeater sub."
1668MA-MAC-AMO,Brief Description of Service - 2.0 DATA ACQUISITION OPERATING MODES,"DATA ACQUISITION OPERATING MODES
The operation mode is software selected: receiver, sample period, type of analysis and customer
presentation.  Engineer interaction is minimal (user friendly).
Full Waveform data is available from either (or both) dipole directions, and from the monopole
transducers.  The number of modes that can be activated during one trip through the well is a
function of the logging speed.  The use of four A/D converters increases the data acquisition
rate, facilitating the use of stacking to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
Both real time compressional and shear slowness measurement, via first arrival picking
(threshold detection), and full wave processing are available.  The log consists of a minimum of
three tracks.  The Vp/Vs ratio is presented on track 1 along with Gamma Ray and Caliper data.
Tracks 2 and 3 present the monopole, dipole and cross dipole slownesses.  A fourth track is
commonly provided for a quality control curve."

INTRODUCTION
The following descriptions are for printed circuit assemblies that are a part of the Multipole
Acoustic Instrument.  The text is organized in two sections: the first section presents an
overview of the serial communications format and the second presents the Receiver electronics."
1668MA-MAC-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 2.0 SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS OVERVIEW . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,"SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS OVERVIEW

Serial communications issued from the Acoustic Common consists of four specialized lines.
These lines are: Serial Data, Clock, R/W, and Fire.  The Clock and R/W lines are made
concurrently available to all assemblies which operate on the serial data communications bus.
Serial Data is passed through receiving shift registers and then made available to the next using
assembly.  The Serial Data line is serially linked (as contrasted to the paralleling linking of the
Clock and R/W lines).  The Fire line is made available to the transmitter interface board which
uses this control signal to initiate the firing sequence of the transmitters.
In the Multipole Array Acoustilog, there are four assemblies which use the serial
communications bus; the S-Wave and P-Wave Xmitter Interface boards in the 1668 FA
Transmitter Electronics and the two Analog Receiver boards in the 1668 MA Receiver
Electronics.
The Acoustic Common serially writes to all assemblies by using an 8 BYTE serial data
message.  BYTE 1 on the line is used to select and control the firing of the S-Wave
Transmitters.  BYTE 2 is used to select and control the firing ofthe P-Wave Transmitters.
BYTES 3, 4 & 5 select and control receiver input, Log-Test option, signal attenuation, amplifier
gains and High Pass and Low Pass filter settings of the Receiver Electronics assembly on Side 1
of the chassis (Channel 1 & 2 Refer to Dwg. 157025-000).  BYTES 6, 7 & 8 are used for that
same purpose with the Receiver Electronics assembly on Side 2 of the chassis (channels 3 & 4).

SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS OVERVIEW (CONTINUED)
The serial data line is received first by the Side 2 Receiver Electronics assembly (channel 3&4),
passed through its 3 shift registers and then made available to the Receiver Electronics assembly
mounted on Side 1 of the chassis (Channel 1 & 2).  The serial data is again shifted through 3
registers and then passed to the Transmitter Electronics.  In this way, the first byte on the line
shifts through 7 registers before being received at the S-Wave Xmitter Interface.  Figure 945-1
shows the serial data flow and the order of the control bytes sent to the instrument."
1668MA-MAC-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.0 ANALOG RECEIVER . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,"ANALOG RECEIVER
(REFERENCE SCHEMATIC P/N 157025-100)
The Receiver subassembly houses two Receiver Boards (157016-000).  The boards are mounted
on the Receiver backbone (R157025-000).  Figure 945-2 illustrates the functional representation
of assembly 157025-000.
Each assembly (Receiver board) has two channels through which the signals are routed (Even
and Odd).  The EVEN channel has 4 inputs, 2 P-Wave and 2 S-Wave and the ODD channel also
has 4 inputs, 2 P-Wave and 2 S-Wave.  Each MAC Electronic Assembly has two Analog
Receiver assemblies, therefore, a total of four P-Wave or four S-Wave signals can be processed
simultaneously.
The Analog Receiver assembly receives serial communications from the Acoustic Common and
responds to its commands.
Four command specifications are implemented:
1.
Selection of two inputs (one signal from the EVEN data channel and one from the
ODD channel) on each board
2.
Log or test selection for all channels
3.
Independent gain settings for the ODD and EVEN channels on each board
4.
Selection of low and high filter cutoff frequencies for each board"

(REFERENCE SCHEMATIC P/N 157016-100)
This board contains two identical channels, each of which contains multiplexers, amplifiers, an
attenuation network and bandpass filters for processing signals from both
Monopole (P-wave) and Dipole (S-wave) receivers.
In addition, shift registers U8, U9, and U10 receive strobe, clock and serial data from the
1667 EA Acoustic Electronics Common cartridge for controlling the various multiplexers.  Serial
data is shifted out of U8 to P-02 for transmission to the second Receiver Board or to the
Transmitter Electronics for controlling the transmitter firings.
+15 VDC and -15 VDC power is also supplied from the Acoustic Electronics Cartridge.

Since both channels are identical, only one is described from input to output.
Four differential signals, two P-wave and two S-wave, enter the board from connector
P-01.  They are connected to multiplexer U1.  The software selected signal passed by U1 is
connected to input 1 of multiplexer U2.  U2 is controlled by software to pass the signal from U1;
a test signal, which is connected to both channels, or to tie input of the following  circuitry to
ground.  Figure 945-4 contains codes and code sources for controlling Receiver Select
multiplexers U1 and U11 and Log-Test multiplexers U2 and U12.  Additionally, the receiver
selected for both side 1 and side 2 boards is shown.
resistor network RN3 and multiplexer U4.  The output of U3 can be attenuated in 8 steps,3db
per step, and is software controlled.

MAC RECEIVER BOARD (CONTINUED)
The output of the attenuator is sent to input amplifier U5 (1/4 of an OP471 Quad Amp). One half
of multiplexer U6 switches resistors in the feedback of amplifier U5 to give 4 software
controlled steps of gain.  The second half of U6 controls the gain of the output amplifier, another
section of U5, therefore both amplifiers are switched to the same gain settings by the serial data
input.

The output of amplifier U5 is sent to the input of a 4 pole high pass filter which has three
software controlled cutoff frequencies.  The frequencies are 500 Hz,1000 Hz,and1500 Hz and are
determined by resistors switched by multiplexers U16 and U17.  The throughput gain of the
filter section is 2.57 V/V (8.2dB).  Figure 945-7 shows the code and code source for the
selection of the high pass cutoff frequencies.

MAC RECEIVER BOARD (CONTINUED)
The output of the high pass filter is passed to the input of a 4 pole low pass filter which has three
software controlled cutoff frequencies.  The frequencies are 3kHz, 5kHz and 23kHz, and are
determined by resistors switched by multiplexers U18 and U19.  The throughput gain of the
filter section is 2.57 V/V (8.2 dB).  Figure 945-8 shows the code and code source for the
selection of the low pass cutoff frequencies.
been previously discussed.
The output of amplifier U5 is routed to connector P-2 for transmission to the 1667 EA Acoustic
Electronics Cartridge."

CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION - 1668 BA MULTIPOLE ARRAY ACOUSTILOG 
INTRODUCTION
The Transmitter Mandrel contains transformers and transmitting elements for generating omni-
directional acoustic waves (monopole transmitter) and uni-directional acoustic waves (dipole
transmitter). Two transmitters of each type is contained in the assembly."
1668MA-MAC-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 2.0 MONOPOLE TRANSMITTER,"MONOPOLE TRANSMITTER
The Monopole Transmitter #1 Circuit within the 1668 BA Transmitter Mandrel consists of
œ
Pulse Transformer T1 (32 T/500 T) and Monopole Transmitter #1. (Refer to Figure 945-1.)
Monopole Transmitter #1 consists of two piezoelectric cylinders connected in parallel and a
damping diode.

MONOPOLE TRANSMITTER (CONTINUED)
When the P-Wave FIRE1 circuit is activated, capacitor C1 (on the Transmitter Electronics
Assembly) is discharged through the primary of transformer T1.  The resulting high voltage,
developed across T1's secondary (approximately 4kV peak and 50 microseconds wide) is
applied to the Transmitter Crystals.  An omni-directional pressure wave is generated into the
surrounding fluid medium.
The diode, connected across T1's secondary, functions to damp the monpole transducer's
ringing.
The Monopole Transmitter #2 Circuit operates the same as previously described."
1668MA-MAC-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.0 DIPOLE TRANSMITTER,"DIPOLE TRANSMITTER
The Dipole Transmitter #3 Circuit within the 1668 BA Transmitter Mandrel consists of Pulse
œ
Transformer T3 (820 T/4920 T), Dipole Transmitter #3, and biasing components R1 and C1.
(Refer to Figure 945-2.)

DIPOLE TRANSMITTER (CONTINUED)
Dipole Transmitter #3 consists of two piezoelectric plates cemented to a conductive substrate
œ
with conductive epoxy.  One plate is cemented with its positive side in contact with the
substrate.  The other plate is cemented with its negative side in contact with the opposite side of
œ
the substrate.  One side of the secondary of T3 is electrically connected to the substrate.  The
œ
other side is connected to the outside of both piezoelectric plates.
œ
When the S-Wave FIRE1 circuit is activated, capacitor C1 (on the Transmitter Electronics
Assembly) is discharged through the primary of transformer T3.  The resulting high voltage,
developed across T3's secondary (approximately 2.4 kV peak and 210 microseconds wide), is
applied across both piezoelectric plates and the center substrate.  Since the piezoelectric plates
œ
are connected with opposite polarities, one plate expands in length and the other contracts.  This
causes the substrate to bend, generating a bi-directional pressure wave into the surrounding fluid
œ
medium.
The piezoelectric plates are polarized and can be depoled by applying a high reverse polarity
voltage.  When Dipole FIRE1 is active, a negative-going, high voltage pulse is developed across
T3's secondary.  The R1-C1 bias circuit functions to prevent the 'plus side' plate from depoling.
A constant high dc voltage (approximately 410 Vdc) is applied to the plate (HV COM), repoling
it during the FIRE Pulse's off time.
The Dipole Transmitter #4 Circuit operates the same as previously described."

WARNING
THE BENDER-PLATES CAN DEVELOP AN EXTREMELY LARGE
ELECTRICAL CHARGE.  ALWAYS DISCHARGE THE PIEZOELECTRIC
CRYSTALS TO THE CONDUCTIVE SUBSTRATE BEFORE HANDLING.
CAUTION
THE BENDER-PLATES ARE FRAGILE.  ALWAYS HANDLE WITH GREAT
CARE AND NEVER PULL ON THE ELECTRICAL LEADS.
3.
Without the TEFLON INSULATORS [33], trial fit the BENDER-PLATES [23] into the
UPPER and LOWER HOUSINGS [08 & 09] with the JAWS [40], CLAMPS [39], and
SHOULDER SCREWS [43].  Note that the SCREWS should slide into place easily once
the components are aligned.  The SCREWS should clamp the assembly together without
any binding.

BENDER-PLATE TRANSDUCER MOUNTING (CONTINUED)
NOTE
The BENDER-PLATES must be oriented with the positive ""+"" side (i.e., the
red wire) facing upward toward the CLAMPS.  This is required for the correct
polarization of the dipole signal.
4.
Work on one BENDER-PLATE and HOUSING at a time.
5.
Remove the four SHOULDER SCREWS from the HOUSING.  Disassembly the
BENDER-PLATE, JAWS, AND CLAMPS.
6.
On one of the CLAMPS, install two INSULATED TERMINALS [37] with one drop of
LOCTITE [59].  Install one TERMINAL with a WIRE LUG [45] and the other with a
LOCK WASHER [38].
7.
With dial calipers, measure the width of the open in the HOUSING.  Record the exact
value.  It should be within the range of 2.040 ± .005.""
8.
Measure the width of the BENDER-PLATE with two TEFLON INSULATORS [33] in
place, one on each of the long edges.
9.
On a flat surface with sandpaper, sand each of the TEFLON INSULATORS equally to
produce a .002"" to .005"" clearance between each of the INSULATORS and the
HOUSING.  Trail fitting the BENDER-PLATE and INSULATORS into the HOUSING
frequently during the sanding.
CAUTION
DO NOT OVER SAND OR SAND THROUGH THE TEFLON INSULATORS.
THE BENDER-PLATE WILL SHORT CIRCUIT WITHOUT PROPER
INSULATION.
10.
When the proper clearance has been obtained, clean and degrease the TEFLON
INSULATORS and the BENDER-PLATE.  From this point on, do not touch the edges of
the BENDER-PLATE.
11.
Install the BENDER-PLATE and TEFLON INSULATORS into the HOUSING with the
four JAWS, two CLAMPS, and the four SHOULDER SCREWS.  Hand tighten the screws
to secure the assembly in place.  Check that the BENDER-PLATES are oriented with the
positive ""+"" side, i.e. the red wire, facing upward towards the CLAMPS.  Also check
that the electrical leads on the BENDER-PLATES and the CLAMP with the insulated
terminals are orientated in the downhole direction.

BENDER-PLATE TRANSDUCER MOUNTING (CONTINUED)
12.
Inspect the clearance between the INSULATORS and the HOUSING.  Double check the
orientation of the BENDER-PLATE.  Repeat steps 6-11, if necessary.
NOTE
The BENDER-PLATE and INSULATORS should slide easily into the
HOUSING.  The clearance should allow a piece of paper to slide between the
INSULATORS and the HOUSING over the entire length of the BENDER-
PLATE without any sticking.
13.
One at a time, Remove each of the SHOULDER SCREWS, apply LOCTITE [59], and re-
install tightly.
14.
Inspect the clearance between the INSULATORS and the HOUSING again.  Repeat steps
6-13, if necessary.
15.
Repeat steps 5-14 for the remaining BENDER-PLATE and HOUSING.
16.
Cover the BENDER PLATES' black lead with a piece of TEFLON TUBING [57] and
feed it through the aligned holes in the JAWS and BENDER-PLATE.
17.
Referring to the wiring diagram, connect the electrical leads from the BENDER-PLATES
and a twisted triplet of wire to the INSULATED TERMINALS and GROUND LUGS on
the downhole CLAMPS.  Use HI-TEMP SOLDER [52].  Note the color code for the
wiring from the diagram.  The twisted triplets should have 3 to 5 turns per inch to
suppress crosstalk.
18.
Carefully inspect the BENDER-PLATES' mounting and orientation.  Inspect the electrical
connections.  Double check that the sides of the BENDER-PLATES and INSULATORS
have sufficient clearance with the HOUSINGS.
NOTE
The physical mounting of the BENDER-PLATES is crucial for their correct
operation.

1668MA-MAC-AMO,Assembly/Disassembly Procedures - 7.0 DIPOLE CONFIGURATION MODIFICATION PROCEDURE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32,"DIPOLE CONFIGURATION MODIFICATION PROCEDURE
This section outlines the modification procedures to convert the 1668 BA MAC TRANSMITTER
MANDREL between the IN-LINE dipole configuration and the 2-AXIS dipole configuration.
CAUTION
SERIOUS DAMAGE WILL OCCUR TO THE 1668 BA MAC
TRANSMITTER MANDREL IF THE DIPOLE TRANSMITTERS ARE
ROTATED WHILE THE ROTATION JOINT IS SUBJECTED TO EITHER
A BENDING OR TENSILE LOAD.
1.
Refer to the assembly drawing [R-156905-000] and parts list for the 1668 BA MAC
TRANSMITTER MANDREL ASSEMBLY.
2.
Disconnect the 1668 BA TRANSMITTER MANDREL from the 1668 PA Acoustic Isolator
and the 1668 FA Transmitter Electronics.
3.
If TRANSMITTER MANDREL has been logged, use a high pressure water or similar
manner to thoroughly clean the rotating joint, Section G-G.
4.
Support the entire length of the TRANSMITTER MANDREL so that no bending moment
or tensile load is generated across the rotating joint.
5.
Remove the four ½-13 FLAT HEAD SCREWS [18] from the rotating joint, referenced as
Section G-G on assembly drawing R-156905-000.  Replace any or all of the ½-13 FLAT
HEAD SCREWS if the hex sockets have been damaged.
NOTE
The rotating joint has a ""DIPOLE ALIGNMENT"" mark which may be
orientated to either the ""-0- DEG"" or ""-90- DEG"" positions for the In-Line or 2-
Axis configurations, respectively.

DIPOLE CONFIGURATION MODIFICATION PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)
6.
To modify the configuration turn the rotating joint 90 E.  With a spanner wrench, rotate
the uphole portion of the TRANSMITTER MANDREL so that either the ""-0- DEG"" or ""-
90- DEG"" timing mark aligns with the DIPOLE ALIGNMENT mark.  Do not rotate more
than 90 E.  The rotating joint should turn easily with less than 20 ft-lbs of torque.  If this
joint does not turn easily, do not try to force it; instead, reposition the TRANSMITTER
MANDREL to insure that no bending moment is applied across the joint and apply some
lubricant.
DIPOLE ALIGNMENT

CAUTION
THE ROTATING JOINT SHOULD TURN EASILY AND SHOULD NEVER BE
ROTATED MORE THAN 90 E.  FORCING THE JOINT TO TURN OR OVER
ROTATING WILL CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE.
7.
Install the four ½-13 FLAT HEAD SCREWS [18] with RTV ADHESIVE [47].  Tighten
with a torque wrench to 50 ft-lbs torque.

INTRODUCTION
The Circumferential Borehole Imaging Log (CBIL
)  is an acoustic device designed to produce detailed
SM 1
images of the wellbore wall (or casing).  The CBIL pulse-echo transducer emits a high frequency
acoustic pulse and measures the amplitude and the time of flight of the reflected wave.  The amplitude
of the reflected wave is affected by variations in the borehole surface.  The travel time is indicative of
the distance from the transducer to the wellbore wall.  The acoustic transducer is mounted on a rotating
section, allowing the CBIL to scan the full 360 degrees of the wellbore producing two images or maps.
The Reflectance Amplitude image will show borehole surface features.  Highly reflective formation
features are represented as white, while less reflective features are represented as black.  All values
between the extremes are assigned a shade of gray, varying proportionally to the value of the measured
property. This map is especially useful for detection of such low reflective features as fractures.  The
reflectance amplitude is affected by mud attenuation, tool eccentering and borehole rugosity.
The travel time image is a sensitive measurement of borehole ellipticity, rugosity, and tool position. 
Combined with the mud slowness measurement, the time of flight data can be used to produce an
accurate measurement of the borehole radius.  The shade of gray assigned to the travel time value is
proportional to the distance the tool is from the wellbore wall, where darker shades are indicative of an
enlarged borehole.  This measurement is affected by mud slowness, tool eccentering and borehole
rugosity.
DCBIL system applications include:
• Orientation and depth matching of whole cores.
• Detection and measurement of fractures, vugs, and washouts.
• Determination of bedding planes and fracture orientations.
• Determination of detailed borehole geometry with high-resolution acoustic caliper      
  data. 
• Determination of sand/shale distributions in thinly bedded intervals.
• Location and evaluation of internal casing corrosion, mechanical wear, defects, and    
perforations.
• Dip Determination"

1671EBMB-CBIL-AMO,Mechanical Description - 3.1 ROTATING SECTION,"ROTATING SECTION
The rotating section contains the motor, gearbox, rotary transformers, imaging transducer, and
magnetometer sub-assemblies.  This section of the instrument is oil filled and pressure compensated.
The motor/gear box assembly contains an AC induction motor and a double reduction gearbox.
Magnetic pickup units are used in the gearbox to provide speed and tool orientation information.
Power from the gear-box is transmitted through an offset shaft to the rotating transducer assembly.
The rotating assembly consists of four rotary transformers, two transducers, and a magnetometer
mounted on a tube shaft.  This shaft is supported at each end by Vespel sleeve bearings.  The four rotor
cores of the transformers carry the signals from the rotating transducers and magnetometer back to the
fixed portion of the transformers (stators).  Transducers transmit acoustic energy that is reflected off the
borehole wall and received by the same transducer.  The magnetometer is mounted on the lower end of
transducer unit and provides compass orientation data that is used with the signal received by the
transducers.
Volume/pressure compensation is provided by an oil filled bellows at the bottom of rotating
mechanism.  A groove on the bellows housing provides a reference mark showing the tool is full at
room temperature.  Oil filling ports are mounted in the bellows and in the mud sub-assembly."

The mud sub performs several tasks in the Digital CBIL instrument:
•
Mud slowness measurement
•
Mechanical crossover
•
Electrical connection and pressure isolation
•
Mounting for magnetometer tuning capacitors
a)
Mud Slowness
The mud slowness is measured in a mud channel across which a transducer is pulsed.  The
spacing of the channel is adjusted by installing or removing an auxiliary target.
b)
Crossover
The mud sub acts as a mechanical crossover between the rotating section (3-5/8"") and the MA
electronics (3-3/8"").
c)
Electrical Connection/Pressure Isolation
A bulkhead at the top of the mud sub provides electrical feedthroughs and pressure isolation
between the lower and upper sections of the mandrel assembly.
d)
Magnetometer Capacitors
The space immediately above the pressure bulkhead is utilized to mount a PCB upon which the
magnetometer tuning capacitors are mounted."

The output of IC3 is controlled by (internal) tristate gates.  The converted digital value is passed from
IC3 to the FIFO (IC4) by the falling edge of CLK (IC3 pin 1).
The flash converter IC3 requires a 0.0 to +5 V unipolar signal.  This requires that the ±2.5 volt bipolar
signal from the PHA Board be level shifted by +2.5 volts.  This is accomplished by adding +2.5 Vdc
from pin 22 of the flash converter chip to the signal at the positive input of IC1.  The +2.5 Vdc is
jumpered to point A."

(Reference drawings 182481-000 and 182481-100)
The 1671 EB Electronics houses the ±15 and +5 Volt dc power supplies for the EB and MB
electronics.
Transformer T2 steps down the 180 Vrms from conductors 1 and 4 to about 150 Vrms.  This voltage is
full-wave rectified by BR01 and filtered by C9, C10, C11, C12, R6, R7, and L1.  With all PC boards
in the EB connected, and no MB attached, the voltage across C10 will measure about 155 Vdc.  This
voltage is applied to the 160 V Regulator circuit through protector diode D10.  The regulator circuit
maintains it output voltage between 150 and 160 Vdc.  This voltage provides an imbalance bias voltage
through R4 to turn on Q1 and start the required oscillation in the primary of T1.
Transformer T1's top secondary circuit provides about ±27.5 Vdc to the ±15 Vdc regulators, IC2 and
IC3.  The bottom secondary circuit of T1 provides about 15 Vdc to the input of the +5 Vdc regulator
IC1.  The output of the IC regulators should be within 1% of their nominal output voltage.  The
approximate current supplied by each regulator is -

WTS BUS DRIVER
(Reference drawing B182852-100)
%
The WTS bus driver card serves as the interface to the WTS instrument bus for the 1671 EB.
Commands and data are received (T2 mode) on conductors 27 (CMD+) and 28 (CMD-) of the WTS
instrument bus.  These signals are routed to P1-13 and P1-6 respectively on the WTS bus driver board.
The signals are transformer coupled off the line by T2 and are received through the dual differential line
receiver U2.  This provides a single ended signal (UDI) which is routed to the decoder section of the
6408 Manchester located on the CPU board.  If the 1671 EB is transmitting up T2 mode, the BZO (P1-
2) and BOO (P1-3) outputs of the 6408 Manchester on the CPU board are driven by the dual line driver
U1, and then transformer coupled by T1 onto the WTS instrument bus.  The signals go out on P1-9 and
P1-8 which are tied to conductors 29 and 30 respectively on the WTS instrument bus.
In a T5 mode of transmission the BZO (P1-4) and BOO (P1-5) outputs of the high speed 6409 Harris
Manchester on the CPU board are driven by the dual line driver U3, and then transformer coupled by
T3 onto the WTS instrument bus.  The signals are taken off the line driver board, through P1-11 and
P1-10, and tied to the instrument bus on conductors 31 and 32 respectively.
In a T7 mode of transmission the BZO (P1-4) and BOO (P1-5) outputs of the high speed 6409 Harris
Manchester on the CPU board are driven by the dual line driver U4, and then transformer coupled by
T4 onto the WTS instrument bus.  The signals are taken off the line driver board, through P1-15 and
P1-16, and tied to the instrument bus on conductors 15 and 16 respectively.
Below is a summary of the modes of transmission supported by the 1671 EB.

COMMUNICATION INTERFACE
Communication is handled through an interrupt driven system.  Data rate for T2 mode is 20.8 kbits/sec
receiving and 41.6 kbits/sec transmitting.  T5 mode is unidirectional and is only used for transmitting to
the surface at a rate of 93.75 kbits/sec.  T2 mode is controlled by the 6408 Harris Manchester chip
(IC11).  The 6408 is comprised of a Decoder and Encoder section which are described separately
below.  T5 mode transmission is controlled by the Encoder section of the 6409 Harris Manchester chip
(IC12) described in the Encoder Section (Section 6.2).

DECODER SECTION
CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION - 1671 EB/MB CIRCUMFERENTIAL BOREHOLE IMAGING LOG




4.3.1
DECODER SECTION (Cont'd)
A 16 MHz base oscillator (IC28) is divided down by the dual binary counter (IC20) to provide the 250
kHz source clock to the decoder clock input (IC11-5).  Data is received serially through the buffer
protected UDI input of the 6408 (IC11-8) which monitors the data for a valid sync pattern.  Once a
valid sync pattern has been recognized the take data output (TD) (IC11-3) will go high, and if the sync
pattern was that of a command type the command data sync line (CDS) (IC11-10) will also go high.
The falling edge of the take data and command sync lines cause a corresponding interrupt to be
triggered through the flip-flop (IC19 pin 5 and 1).  If the word received was of data type the flip-flop
output (IC19-9) set by take data will be the only interrupt set which is  responded to by the
microcontroller.  If the word received was of command type, then both outputs of the flip-flop (IC19-
9and12) are set and the microcontroller, handling the interrupts on a priority basis, recognizes the word
received as being a command.  The microcontroller responds to a data received interrupt (command or
data type) by reading the word from the parallel outputs of the shift registers (IC14 and IC13).  The
interrupts generated by a word being received are cleared when the reset lines (IC19-6and2) are pulled
low for the duration of the read cycle on the low byte of the word received (stored in IC14).
The valid word output (VW) (IC11-1) is monitored by the microcontroller to indicate the validity of the
word received.
4.3.2
ENCODER SECTION
Timing diagrams for each encoder section can be found in Figures 945-4 and 945-5.  Transmission of
data to the surface system for the 1671 EB is controlled by either the encoder section of the 6408 (T2
mode) or the 6409 (T5 mode) Harris Manchester chips (IC11 and IC12).  The encoder used is
determined by the type of data sent to the surface.  The encoder clock (IC11-23) for T2 mode is selected
(jumper X to Z) to deliver a 500 kHz clock which is derived from the base 16 MHz (IC28) oscillator
being divided down through the dual binary counter (IC20).  The encoder clock for the T5 mode

MHz clock to the input of the encoder of the 6409 (IC12-12).
Enabling of the T2 mode encoder is accomplished by the microcontroller (IC1) setting a control latch
bit (IC27-2) high which is gated with the system reset (IC31-3).  This gating is required in order to keep
the T2 mode encoder disabled until the microcontroller has initialized setups properly upon power-up.
The T5 mode encoder is enabled by pulling a control latch bit (IC27-5) low.  The encoder shift clocks
for both encoder sections (6408 and 6409) are gated together for an output on IC32-11.  When either of
the encoders are enabled, but never both, the bit counter IC17 will be clocked."
1671EBMB-CBIL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 4.4 I/O BUS,"I/O BUS

I/O BUS
A universal 20 conductor bus has been established which allows the CPU to access data from peripheral
boards which are tied to this bus.  Below are the bus specifications.
BUS SPECIFICATIONS
-
An I/O control line (IC41-11) enables the decoding logic on each board connected to the
bus.
-
A 4-bit address bus which uses the upper two bits (AD3 and AD2) to decode the particular
board and the lower two bits (AD1 and AD0) to decode the specific device on the addressed
board.
-
An 8-bit data bus which serves as a bi-directional path for data transfer.
-
A conversion clock is available for the A/D modules connected to the bus, but it is only
active during an acquisition cycle.
-
The remainder of the bus is made up of the power supplies and grounds which consist of the
following: +15 V, -15 V, +5 V, DGND, and AGND.
The 8-bit bi-directional data bus is buffered through an octal transceiver (IC40).  The 4 bit address bus
is buffered by one half of an octal buffer (IC41) with the I/O control line and conversion clock being
buffered in the other half.  The supply voltages and grounds emanate from the power supply external to
the flasked electronics.  This 20 conductor I/O bus is made available to peripheral boards through a bus
distribution board which is connected to the CPU board."

A/D CONTROL
Sample rate for A/D modules is programmable from 62.5 kHz to 8 MHz and the number of samples
which are to be accumulated is programmable from 1-4095 samples.  The variable sample rate is
achieved by dividing a base clock (IC28) of 16 MHz down (with cascaded binary counters IC25 and
IC26) with a value which is stored in a latch (IC21).  Due to timing synchronization the base clock
frequency is always divided down by one more than the value stored in the latch (IC21).  The relative
timing for the variable conversion clock is shown in Figure 945-6 on the following page."

Gain Control of the pulse-echo signal is accomplished with U1,U2,U3,U4,U5,U12,U14 and their
associated passive components. U12 provides the required gain control codes.  U3 and U4 are

(Reference drawing 148682-100)
The Flash Converter is high speed 8 bit A/D.  In this application, the input signals are the pulse-echo
signals from the Rotating Section's ultrasonic transducers.  There are five circuits that compose this
assembly:
. Clock/Reset control
. Flash Converter
. Data Store
. Decoder
. Level shifting.
Clock/Reset control: IC5 receives the A/D clock signal from the PHA board and provides the inverted
value to the CLK input of IC3.  Jumper options are provided to connect pins 12 and 13 together, or to
allow for external control.  In the 1671 CBIL these pins are NOT connected as seperate A/D CLOCK
and A/D ENABLE signals are used.
Pin 2 of IC5 receives the Reset (eg, reset IC3) command from IC7 and provides adequate timing delay
(approximately 15 n seconds) to cause Write to remain high for the required period after Reset (bar RS,
pin 22 of IC4) goes high.
Flash Convert Sequence: A/D CLOCK is input from the PHA board to IC 5-12 during every positive
MSYNC cycle.These 31 n second, positive A/D CLOCK pulses are 0.25  seconds apart (as selected in
the EDIT TABLE).  A/D CLK ENABLE (IC 5-13) is high during one of these MSYNC cycles, as
selected in the CBIL EDIT TABLE as SIGNATURE NUMBER (element number 11).This enables the
A/D CLK pulses at IC 5-12 to pass through IC5-11 to become the CLK for FLASH CONVERTER IC3-
1.As long as RESET (IC4-22) is held high, these same pulses also propagate through the remaining
gates of IC5 to become FIFO WRITE at IC4-1.  The falling edge of CLK (IC3-1) puts the digital word
on IC3 outputs where it is written into the FIFO on the falling edge of FIFI WRITE, IC4-1.
Subsequent FIFO READS will place the digital conversions on the data bus."

(Reference drawing 148681-000)
The Magnetometer Board accepts the three magnetic sensor signals from the Rotating Section and
provides the following three signals:

MARK  - Tool Body Mark orientation
TREF  - Fire pulse (prompts transducer firing)
NORTH - Compass orientation
The Tool Body Mark magnetic sensor in the Rotating Section generates a 150 mVpp (± 50 mVpp)
signal when the 1.5"" rotating transducer rotates past the tool body mark scribe on the outside surface of
the Rotating Section.  This signal is received by the differential amplifier circuit U1.  The diff amp has
a gain of about 60.  The output of the diff amp is compared to the -1.79 Vdc reference threshold by
comparator U4.  The output of U4 goes HIGH, generating the MARK pulse, when the input on pin 5 is
below the -1.79 Vdc threshold.
Signal TREF originates in the Rotating Section.  The signal is produced from a magnetic pickup
transducer activated by an indexed wheel on the rotating shaft.  The wheel has 25 holes and rotates 5
revolutions for each rotation of the imaging transducer platform. With the transducers rotating at
approximately 6 revolutions per second the magnetic transducer pickup will produce an analog signal of
approximately 750 cycles per second (6 rev./sec)(125 cycles/rev) = 750 cycles/sec.
The analog signal from the magnetic pickup is coupled as a differential input.  These two signals TREF
- and TREF + connect to the two inputs of differential amplifier U1 pin 9 and pin 10 through R10 and
R11 respectively.  U1 has a gain of approximately 30.9 which is obtained by resistors R12/R10 and
R13/R11.The output of U1 pin 8 is connected to the inverting input of comparator U4 (pin 10).  The
voltage divider network of R14 and R15 produces a threshold voltage of approximately -.18 volts at the
positive input (pin 9) of U4.  R16 is used for hysteresis.  The output of U4 swings from high (+15
volts) to low (0 volts) when VREF (-.18 volts) exceeds the voltage at the inverting input of U4.  This
produces a square wave signal which is sent through buffer U5 pins 1 and 2.  The combination of the
second and third stage of U5 along with R18,C6, and R19,C7 form a pulse doubler with a pulse width
of approximately 300 s.  This signal is sent to the PHA Board as 2*TREF to initiate firing of the
selected ultrasonic transducer.
The Magnetometer senses magnetic North by use of a flux gate circuit consisting of a coil of wire
wound on a core of saturating, high permability iron alloy.  It detects the intensity of the component of
the earth's magnetic field parallel to the axis of the core."

4.3.2
ENCODER SECTION (Cont'd)
The remainder of the encoder section description applies to either mode of transmission (T2 or T5).
Before the encoder is enabled for a data transmission the buffered parallel to serial shift registers (IC16
and IC15) are loaded with the first two words (16 BIT) to send to the surface.  The shift registers have a
buffered latched input which allows the word being sent as well as the word following to be loaded.  A
control latch bit (IC27-9) must be set low when the first word is loaded into the shift registers (IC16
and IC15) to allow the word to be transferred to the output latches of the shift register.  The control
latch bit is then set high and the second word is loaded into the input buffer of the shift registers.  This
preloading of the output latches is only necessary for the first word sent as the remainder of the words
are automatically loaded into the output latches through hardware timing described below.
When the encoder is disabled the output of gate IC32-3 holds the bit counter (IC17) in a load mode and
the word boundary indicator (IC18) in a reset mode.  Enabling the encoder causes the bit counter to be
incremented by the gated encoder shift clock (IC32-11).  When the 16th bit has been clocked the falling
edge of the bit counter (IC17-7) causes the word boundary indicator (IC18-8) to go low which causes
the following events to occur.
-
A low output on the word boundary indicator (IC18-8) results in a low level output on IC31-
11 which loads in the next word from the input to output buffers on IC16 and IC15.

An encoder interrupt is generated as a result of the word boundary indicator (falling edge of
IC18-8) causing a high level on IC18-12 which is recognized on the NMI (IC1-7) input of
the microcontroller.  This interrupt prompts the microcontroller to load the next word of the
transmission block into the input  buffers of the shift registers (IC16 and IC15).  When the
low byte of the word is loaded (Write to IC16-12) the encoder interrupt (IC18-12) is
disabled by the reset line (IC18-2) being pulled low for the duration of the write cycle.
-
The low output of the word boundary indicator (IC18-8) also resets itself and the bit counter
by pulling its reset line (IC18-6) and the bit counters load line (IC17-11) low which sets
them both back to their reset conditions.  The bit counter is reloaded with a value of zero
before the shifting of the next word.
The above process is carried out for each word transmitted to the surface until the last word of the data
block is transmitted.  With the utilization of the double buffering in the shift registers (IC16 and IC15),
it is necessary to write one more word than is actually sent, in order to actuate the loading of the last
word in the data block from the input to output buffers of the shift registers."

A/D CONTROL (Cont'd)
Once the cascaded counters (IC25 and IC26) have decremented down to zero from the value stored in
the latch, a borrow is generated (IC26-13) which clocks flip-flop IC30.  The high out on IC30-12 is the
high period of the conversion clock and is gated with the base 16 MHz clock to allow a 31.25 ns high
pulse before resetting IC30.  At the same time IC30-13 is low, which reloads the cascaded counters
(IC25 and IC26) with their original count value to start the process over.  This process goes on
continually with the high state of the continuous clock IC30-12 at a fixed period of 31.25 ns but the low
state will vary based on the sample rate.  This non-symmetrical duty cycle was necessary to meet A/D
module set up specifications.  The continuous conversion clock IC30-12 is present at the
synchronization flip-flop IC29-5 so as soon as a source fire sync (IC29-1) has been issued by the
microcontroller (IC1-46) to initiate the start of an acquisition cycle, the conversion clock will be
enabled (IC29-9) at the same time.  This rising edge fire sync (IC29-9) is sent to the mandrel to fire the
transmitter as well as enable the A/D converter clock (IC31-8).  The fire sync is routed through a level
translator (IC6-3) where it is sent to the mandrel at a 15 V level (IC6-4).
Once the converter clock is enabled (IC31-8) it decrements the sample counters (cascaded binary
counters IC22, IC23, IC24)  which when decremented to zero (end of sample accumulation) causes a
borrow (IC24-13) which disables the A/D conversion clock.  These sample counters are loaded up with
the number of samples to accumulate (1 to 4095) prior to each transmitter firing (acquisition cycle).
The converter clock is buffered by IC41 where it is available on the I/O bus."

PULSE HEIGHT ANALYZER (Cont'd)
The outputs of U1, U3 and U4 are inputs to U5.  By controlling the address code of U5, the output at
U5 pin 8 is connected to either U1, U3 or U4.  Note that the same code is present at pins 5 and 4 of
U14.  U14 is used to connect\disconnect the outputs of the individual gain stages to minimize the
crosstalk at the input pins of U5.
U5 and U14 provide 24, 3 dB (X1.414) gain steps.  For example, for a voltage gain of 2895, the gain of
U1 is set to 11.31 and the code at U5 is set to select the output from U4.  U14 switches to connect U1,
U3 and U4.  Sinc U3 and U4 provide fixed gains of 16, the net gain at pin 8 of U5 is 11.31*16*16
2895 = 69 dB.  U5 also provides attenuation through R38, R39, R40, R41, and R42.

PULSE HEIGHT ANALYZER (Cont'd)
Integrated circuits U6,U7 and U8 make up the Peak Detector circuit.  This circuit detects and holds the
positive peak value of the pulse-echo signal from U5 pin 8.  When pin 15 of IC switch U6 is high, the
circuit is in peak detect mode.  Capacitor C23 is allowed to charge to the positive peak value of the
output of U7 through D2.  The positive peak value is held by C23 and applied to the 12 bit A/D
Converter U9 through buffer U8 and input protection diodes D4 and D5.  The first A/D read, HBEN
""LOW"", puts the low byte on the bus.  The second read, HBEN ""HIGH"", put the four higher order bits
on the bus.  When U6 pin 15 is low the circuit is in reset mode, C23 discharges through U6 pins 3 and
4 and D9 making the circuit ready to accept the next peak value.
Integrated circuits U10 and U11 make up the First Arrival Detector.  U10 is used as a buffer. The
input signal to the comparator is compared to the threshold voltage developed by U12.  This threshold
varies from .2 to 3.1 Vdc.  When the first arrival of the pulse-echo signal is detected, the output of the
comparator goes HIGH.  This stops the 10 MHz, 16 bit counter in U12.  The value of the counter then
represents the elapsed time from transducer firing to the first arrival of the pulse-echo signal.
The portion of the pulse echo signal developed across R12 is sent to the input of the Flash Converter
Board, P/N 148682-000.
General Logic\Control: Integrated circuit U12 is an ACTEL `Logic Cell Gate Array' that provides
general control of the other networks.  U15 is a 10 MHz crystal oscillator.
U12 interfaces with the CPU Board via the 8-bit data bus and the control line MSYNC.  U12 includes
the following logic :
. 16-bit binary counter for time measurement of first  data arrival (this is the Transient
Time counter)
.  8-bit Status Register
.  Clock divide logic that outputs 2.5 MHz for the A/D Converter (U9)

Data Store: IC4 is a CMOS First-in/First-out 4096 by 9-bit memory device.  The reads and writes are
internally sequential through use of ring pointers, with no address information required to load and
unload data.  Data is moved in and out of memory through control of the Write and Read pins.  In this
application, bit position Q8 (the 9th bit) is not used.
Write operations are controlled `automatically' by the connection of IC5 pin 8.  When the input A/D
CLK is active, data from IC3 is stored into IC4.
Read operations are controlled by firmware in the CPU board.  When address lines are at
AD3    AD2   AD1   AD0

and D I/O is low, pin 15 of IC4 is low, thereby placing IC4 in Read.
Reset is accomplished whenever the bar Reset input (pin 22) is low.  During reset, both internal read
and write pointers are set to the first location.

If a coil is placed around the core and driven with a current to generate sufficient flux density, the iron
alloy will saturate and permability will be reduced, causing the flux lines due to the earth's field to be
driven out of the core.
The iron alloy core and coil arrangement act as a flux gate to the earth's magnetic flux lines.  When
current is absent from the drive winding, the gate is open and the flux lines tend to locally concentrate
in the core.  When a high current is applied to saturate the core, the gate is closed to the earth's field
flux lines and they resume their original paths undisturbed by the presence of the core.

U8 is a crystal oscillator operating at 42.5 kHz.  U6 pin 12 is used to produce the correct
frequency/phase drive signal needed for the demodulaton of the Magnetometer signal.  The 0 V to +15
V output of U6 pin 1 is shifted to a +7.5 to -7.5 V square wave by network R27, C12, R26, and on U6
pin 12 by network C21, R42.  U2, Q1 and Q2 provide the current gain necessary to saturate the
magnetometer coil.  Resistor R22 limits the current drain from Q1,Q2.
U1 (pins 2,3 and 1) buffers the received magnetometer output.  C20, R41 remove the dc component at
pin 1 of U1 and drives the Y1 input of U7.  U7 is the Burr-Brown 634 SM Precision Analog Multiplier,
used as a phase detector.  The output of U7 contains unwanted frequency components that are filtered
by U1 (pins 5,6 and 7).  Resistors R46, R47 together with capacitors C24, C25 and with resistors
R48,R49 are components used with U1(pins 5,6 and 7) as an active 2-pole Butterworth filter. The
corner frequency of this filter is about 1 kHz.
U3 is a voltage comparator which `squares' the analog orientation signal output from U1 pin 7 ; the
orientation signal North is now represented by the leading edge of the pulse at P6 pin 15.
The phase relationship of the orientation reference signals is critical.  The correct phase is illustrated by
a +7.5 V to -7.5 V signal; resistors R36,R37 scale the voltage to a low value.  (This is intended to
work with the variable gain circuits on the PHA Board.) The control signal at pin 16 of P6 enables the
output of Test Wave when it is high.  EN TEST WAVE originates at the Transmitter board.(Assembly,

Xmitter: The function of the transmitter circuits are to provide a fire pluse to one of three possible
transducers.
Signal MSYNC follows the receipt of serial data; serial data stored in U5 specifies which transmitter is
to be fired.  The rising edge of MSYNC causes a 1.8 µ second pulse at pin 1 of U3.  Stored values in
U3 select one of three possible transmitter circuits.  When the pulse at U3 pin 1 is received, it passes
through U3 to the specified transmitter (eg, transmitter 1, or transmitter 2), or the fluid transmitter
circuit (e.g., transmitter 3).
U4 and U6 are used to select the Fire Pulse width. When IN1 of U6 is selected (default mode) the pulse
width is  1.8 s, when IN2 is selected the pulse width is  .6 s.
NOTE
The components which fire the selected transducer are identical.
Capacitor C09 is the common capacitor which transfers its stored energy (via transformer) to the
specified transducer. Field Effect Transistor(FET) Q2 and Q3 are current amplifiers needed to drive
Q4.  FET Q4 connects C09, through transformer T1, to the 1 ½ inch transducer.  FET's Q4,5,6 or
FET's Q7,8,9 work in a similar manner through T2 or T3 to fire the 2 inch or the FLUID transducers
respectively.  When U3 enables the appropriate FET gate,the 180 Vdc on the primary of the selected
transformer goes to 0 Vdc for 1.8  second .This pulse causes a 600 to 700 V p-p pulse on the
secondary which will fire the selected transducer.  Current limiting resistor R33, R34, and R35 protects
Q2, Q3, Q5, Q8, and Q9.
Serial interface: U5 and U3 are the serial interface, decode circuits.  U5 is a 8-stage shift/store register
with three state outputs; it receives and stores data (commands) from the 1671 EB.  U3 decodes stored
values output from U5.
Data is serially shifted into U5 pin 2 by signals MDATA and MCLK.  Signal MR/W is held low when
U5 is receiving; thereafter, MR/W is returned high.  The rising edge of MR/W strobes the received
(serial) value to the output pins.  While U5 is inputting, the output pins of U5 are static
(tri-stated)."

Secure the pressure housing (item 1 of R182480-000) with a strap wrench.  Then, install the
WTS Bottom Sub (item 7 of R182480-000) using a pin wrench to rotate the sub.
2.
Orient the timing marks on the pressure housing in an up position for installation of the
electronics assembly.
3.
Rotate the electronics assembly so that the flat ribbon cable is facing upward.  This will reduce
damage to the ribbon cable during insertion into the pressure housing. Insert the electronics
(item 10 of R182480-000) into the pressure housing (item 1 of R182480-000) with the keyed
snout entering first.
4.
The electronics are now resting against the bottom of the housing.  Screw in the
¼-20 T-handle puller (P/N 056036) into the top of the flask adapter on the pigtail end of the
electronics assembly.  The instrument is then twisted while pushing inward until it keys-up with
the bottom sub.
5.
Begin top sub installation.  First feed the pigtail of the electronics assembly through the throat
of the WTS Top Sub (item 6 of R182480-000).
6.
Hold the pigtail with slight tension while screwing the top sub into the pressure housing.
7.
Connect the 32-pin black block (item 7 of C182475-000) to the pigtail.  Carefully, twist it back
into the throat of the WTS Top Sub while seating the block into the sub itself.
8.
Seat the retainer clip (item 8 of C182475-000) into the lock ring groove to secure the black
block.
9.
Install thread protectors for the top sub (item 2 of R182480-000) and the bottom sub
(item 4 of R182480-000) to protect and aid in handling of the instrument."

D182468-000).  Untorque the center sub (item 4 of R182464-000) from the motor housing.  Be
careful that the wires going to the mud velocity transducer (item 23 of D182468-000) do not
tangle with those going through mud sub (item 30 of D182468-000).  Remove the mud sub
body and let the oil drain from the motor housing (item 2 of R182464-000).
NOTE
The majority of the oil will have drained from the tool by this step.
The remaining disassembly will be done on a work bench.
15.
The motor housing can be unscrewed from the center sub without pulling the wires through the
mud sub.  The wires are long enough to allow the motor housing to be slid back from the center
sub. This provides a visual inspection of the power Train.  If power Train maintenance is
required the wires must be pulled through the mud velocity sub.
16.
The wires and boots can be pulled through the mud velocity sub in the following order.  Cut off
any lacing cord tying the wires together on the bulkhead end of the mud velocity sub.
First, individually pull each of the three motor wires through the mud sub by lightly pulling on the
wires ensuring that the boots do not tangle with the other wires.
Next, individually pull each shielded cable through the mud sub.

The test procedures described in sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 require the following Rotating Sub setup:

1.
Place the Rotating Section and 12"" Aluminum Calibrator Sleeve (P/N F157851000) in the
Rotating Sub test tank (If available, use Calibration Stand P/N F156855000).  Fill test tank with
deionized tap water or distilled water which has been completely degassed (by boiling or
standing).  ANY air bubbles will prevent repeatable accurate test results.  Note: If tap water is
used allow it to set for 24 hours for degassing.  If this is not done, the signal will be highly
attenuated due to the thousands of microscopic air bubbles.

2.
Elevate the aluminum sleeve so that it is centered vertically about the Teflon window of the
Rotating Section.  If the Calibration Sleeve is used, the sleeve is automatically positioned.

3.
Align the aluminum sleeve so that it is precisely centered and parallel to the rotating section. If
the Calibration Stand is used, put the pegs in the 12 inch position and place the inside of the
aluminum sleeve against the pegs.  This centralizes the sleeve about the rotating section.  Precise
alignment is assured when the ultrasonic echo signal measured at U7 pin 6 of Transmitter Board,
P/N F182470000 does not vary in time or amplitude."

Place the 1671 MB rotating section in the water filled test barrel.  Center the 12"" aluminum test
sleeve, P/N 157851-000, around the teflon window.
Using a compass, locate magnetic north and align the Tool Body Mark exactly with the compass
needle.

Connect the bottom of the 1671 MB electronics to the top of the rotating section and power up
Instrument to 180 Vac.

Using CBIL keyboard commands, select: AGC off; 2"" Transducer; T.B.M; Signature gate to
140.  Set Reflectance Gain to 36 dB (Reference 1671 EA/MA Gain values in component -976,
Section 8.0).  This will ensure that at least 2 stages of gain are in use on the PHA Board.

Using clip leads and a resistive decade box, connect across R31 on Transmitter Board, P/N
182470-000 such that the observed signal on the A/D Input on the PC screen is between 2 V
and 3 V.  The value of the resistor used across R31 will be approximately equal to 2 K ohms.

Power the Instrument down and remove the clip leads.  Solder a resistor with the value
determined in step 4 across R31 using high temperature solder.
Solder a wire on U4 pin 7 of PCB, P/N 182470-000.  Solder a wire on ground; negative side of
C10 on PCB, P/N 182470-000.
NOTE
Make the wires long enough to reach outside of the oven.

Place the 1671 EB and 1671 MB electronics in the oven.  The 1671 EB electronics will have the
Heat Flask installed.

Repeat steps 2 and 3.

Place a non magnetic target in the water filled barrel such that one edge is aligned directly with
signature number one; i.e. 12 o'clock on the Travel Time Polar Plot.  This target will be used
to determine TBM and Magnetometer drift, so it is critical there is no movement of the rotating
section or target from this point on.  Verify the edge of the target is aligned with the TBM on

LABORATORY HEAT TEST PROCEDURES - 1671 EB/MB CBIL

The procedure will be to record the data in Table 959.1 Temperature Test at room
temperature.  Use whatever CBIL Keyboard commands are necessary to fill in the table for the
following times and temperatures.

To make accurate measurements of the Reflectance Amplitude Plot, set the Shade Levels
(Display Options on the PC screen) for a min/max range of 200 m Volts so the signal plot is in
the middle of this range.  Adjust min/max levels accordingly to maximize the accuracy of your
measurements.  The maximum reflectance amplitude should not vary more than ±10% from the
measurement taken at room temperature.
11.
Use the signature indicator on the Travel Time Polar Plot to determine TBM and Magnetometer
drift.   At room temperature one edge of the target should align with signature number one. 
The edge of the target should not move more than ±1 signature; i.e. the edge of the target
should stay between signature number 250 and signature number 2.
12.
Fire Pulse Width will be measured using a scope connected across the two wires soldered in
step 5, and should not vary more than ±15% from the room temperature measurement.
13.
Travel Time measurement will be made using the signature wave display and cursors on the PC.
NOTE
Be sure to use the same signature number during each measurement.
The measurement should not vary more than ±2% from the room temperature measurement.

INTRODUCTION
The current DCBIL 5721 PC test system software (version 1.01) was not designed to test a
1671 EB/MB STAR Compatible DCBIL.  But it can be made to work by using the work around
instructions at the beginning of section 8.0 (CBIL TABLE EDIT).  Sometime in the future the 5721
PC test system software will be modified to make it easier to test a 1671 EB/MB DCBIL.
The purpose of PC Tool-Diagnostic software (DCDIAG.EXE, and called DCDIAG hereafter) is to aid
the manufacture of quality instruments by providing standardized test methods, and to provide
standardized data records.
This software is for WALS manufacturing personnel and WALS field repair personnel.  This software
operates stand-alone in PC with WTS1 PC printed circuit assembly.
DCDIAG has the same capabilities as Digital CBIL software (DCBIL.EXE) for 3798 Auxiliary
Processor, e.g. Realtime processing and Realtime output, except that DEPTH representation is replaced
by ELAPSE TIME."

curves to be plotted, set curve scales, and choose the type of line plotted.
Curve Names
The user may modify the ASCII names of the curves plotted on the log.  The user
should be aware that changing a curve name does not change the value stored in the
curve. (Changing SPD to TENSION will not generate a tension curve,  the speed
curve will just be named TENSION).
Minimum
Minimum scale, the lowest value that will be plotted on the log.  (This will affect
Aux. curve values displayed on the CRT)
Maximum
Maximum scale, the largest value that will be plotted on the log.  (This will affect
Aux. curve values displayed on the CRT)
TYPE

Selecting this entry presents the table with high and low cut-off values for amplitude image and travel time
image.  The shade level cut-off for the images is determined by the user.
Reflectance (Amplitude)
The values shown represent millivolts (0..5000 mV).  The Minimum
represents the cutoff for black, and any value less than minimum will be
black.  The Maximum represents the shade cutoff for white, and any value
greater than Maximum will be white.  Values between Min and Max are
represented by a grey shade.
Range (Travel Time)
The values shown represent the borehole radius in inches.  The minimum
radius represents the cutoff for white, and any values less than Min will be
White.  The Maximum Radius represents the cutoff for black, and any
values greater than the Max will be black.  Values between Min and Max
are represented by a grey shade.  The scaling for the range is Opposite from
the Amplitude Presentation.  The Maximum radius is used for scaling of the
Polar Plot (see Polar Plot).  The unit is inch in English.  (In Metric, default
unit is mm.  However, if user's response to ""Display Caliper in INCH?

1677 EA 8 CH ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS
P/N 130802-935
MAY 2001 1.0 INTRODUCTION
The 1677 EA 8-channel Acoustic Electronics is WTS compatible and simultaneously acquires up to 8
full waveforms from up to 8 receivers. It is responsible for the data acquisition, downhole analysis,
and telemetry interface for the XMACII (XMAC EliteSM).  The 1677 EA is backward compatible with
the 1680 DAL and 1678 MA XMAC† acoustic instruments by means of a 45 pin to 32 pin crossover
block (P/N 194754-000). The 1677 EA obtains power and communicates with the surface system
through the WTS instrument bus.  The telemetry interface between the 1677 EA and the surface system
meets WTS communication specifications. These specifications are briefly summarized in the
equipment specifications section of this manual.
The 1677 EA attaches to the top of the XMACII receiver mandrel to control reception of signatures
from the mandrel.  Acquired data from the XMACII instrument is sent to the surface via WTS Mode 5
or Mode 7. The telemetry channel is selected via OCT.  Other communications (commands,
downloading and uploading tables, etc.) are conducted on WTS Mode 2.  A tool control table for a
given subset dictates how data is acquired for a given request from the surface system. (Refer to
Interface Specifications, P/N 193329-000.)  The 1677 EA has two 4-channel digital signal processor
(DSP) acquisition cards. Each 4-channel DSP acquisition card has four 16 bit A/D’s and low-noise
preamplifiers.  The CPU card controls communications with the surface and with the DSP acquisition
cards as well as mandrel settings. During an acquisition sequence, the mandrel is set up to select the
transmitter, receivers, and gains based on the acquisition table. (Refer to Interface Specifications, P/N
193329-000).  Mandrel control based on the acquisition table is accomplished through a serial
communication link with the mandrel.

1677 EA 8 CH ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS
P/N 130802-935
MAY 2001 2.0 GENERAL DATA ACQUISITION
The 1677 EA acquires data based on a tool control table (for each subset) which has been down-
loaded to the instrument. Software specifications allow as many as 16 different subsets, with a limit of
four resident in the instrument at one time. Each table (for each subset) contains parameters dictating
the way the instrument acquires the data and where it will originate. Each subset may have one or
more subcycles, with a subcycle consisting of a selected transmitter to be fired and the eight (four)
corresponding receivers to be monitored. Each subcycle has its own parameters associated with it
which govern the acquisition for the specific subcycle. The following outlines the sequence of events
for the 1677 EA to acquire data.
1. Waveform acquisition table (subset) must is downloaded from the surface. Required if subset is
not already resident in the instrument.
2. Request from surface for data acquisition is based on a subset residen t in the instrument.  Data
from the last acquisition is sent up for a current request.
3. The mandrel is set for the correct receiver, gain, and transmitter selection based on the requested
subset.
4. DSP table control (from the CPU board) is set up for the correct number of samples and the
correct sample rate.
5.  The firing sequence is initiated by the DSP, which provides a fire sync for transmitter firing and
starts simultaneous A/D conversions on the eight (four) receiver signals selected in the mandrel
setup.
6.  Data is acquired by the DSPs at a 8 µs sample rate (When DSP filter is 'On' (Normal mode)) for
25 msec (3125 samples).
7. Data is processed by the DSPs.
7.1 Data is averaged (If stacking is used).
7.2  Data decimated (filtered) to selected sample rate.
7.3  Maximum amplitude and time for AGC window is determined.
7.4  Data is compacted or compressed as required.
7.5  Data is then transferred to the CPU board’s memory via two 4-Mbit/Sec Synchronous Serial
Channels connected to the DSP boards.
8. If multiple subcycles, the instrument waits for subcycle time-out, and then begins the next
acquisition sequence as described in steps 3-7.
9. When all subcycles have been completed the instrument waits for the next request from the
surface."

1677EA-XMAC-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 1.2 ACQUISITION TIMING EXAMPLE - STACK OF 2...............................................................4,"ACQUISITION TIMING EXAMPLE - STACK OF 2
Reference Figure 3.
A typical XMACII subset 6 acquisition cycle using a stack of 2 is shown in figure 3.  Subset 6
acquires 3 subcycles.  The first subcycle is a full wave monopole acquiring 330 words of data per
channel (8 channels).  The second subcycle is a inline dipole acquiring 300 words of data per
channel (8 channels).  The third is a delta T  acquiring 100 words of data per channel (4 channels).
The following is a step by step description of the sequence of events that take place.
1.  Ten bytes of mandrel parameters (i.e. transmitter selection, receiver selection, and gains) are
transmitted to the mandrel by the CPU via a 100 KHz synchronous serial communications link.
2.  Next 26 words of DSP parameters (i.e. sample rate, start time, #of words to acquire, etc.) are
sent to all eight DSPs simultaneously by the CPU via a 4 MHz synchronous serial
communications link. The first word of the parameter table contains the command, address,
and number of words.  The first word (in this case) would be hex “5 F1 A,” where 5 is the
command “LOAD TABLE,” F is the universal address, and 1 A is the number of words.  For
more information on DSP commands, tables, etc., see Section 15 in the repair/maintenance
procedures of this manual.
3.  Once the DSPs have received the parameters, the CPU sends a single acquire/stack command
to all eight DSPs simultaneously.
4.  DSP number 1 synchronizes the trigger clock then sends a fire pulse.  The fire pulse is sent
back to the CPU board, then through a level shifter and on to the transmitter.  Note:  The
DSPs acquire data for 25 msec but only process and transmit data as per the acquisition
parameters.
5.  When the 50 msec subcycle length has been reached the CPU sends an acquire/process
command to all eight DSPs simultaneously.
6.  After 36 msec the CPU transmits the next subcycle mandrel parameters.  This allows time for
the completion of gain and receiver switching before the beginning of the next subcyle
acquisition.
7.  After 44 msec the CPU begins to request and receive header data from each DSP (1 word of
max amplitude and 1 word of time of max amplitude). Asking for data at 44 msec of a 50
msec subcycle allows for all of the data to be collected before the end of the 50 msec’s.
8.  When the CPU is finished receiving header data, it begins requesting and receiving channel
data from each DSP.  Since there are two separate 4 MHz receive-serial-communications links
(one per DSP board) two channels of data can be transmitted simultaneously.
9.  When the 50 msec subcycle length has been reached, the process begins again with Step 2
until all subcyles have been acquired."

WTS INTERFACE (MODE 2, MODE 5, AND MODE 7)
Reference Drawing 193325-100 and Figure 5.
Mode 2 Receive Command / Data:  Mode 2 commands / data are sent from the surface and
transformer-coupled via T2 on the CPU board.  U2 converts line signals to TTL levels. The
equivalent of a 6408 Harris Manchester Encoder / Decoder has been incorporated into Actel (U5).
U5 decodes this Manchester protocol data (MD2 UDI) and converts the serial data to parallel data.
U5 checks the received data for a universal address 00 or tool address 03. If either address is
received, interrupt M2 RXIRQ (INT1) is sent to the CPU (U8) and the command is transferred to a
buffer. M2 RXIRQ is reset by the CPU after the command is read by the CPU. If data follows the
WTS command, interrupt M2 RXIRQ (INT1) is sent to the CPU (U8) and the data is transferred to
a buffer. M2 RXIRQ is reset by the CPU after each data word is read.
Mode 2 Transmit Data:  On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit data via Mode 2
(Such as tool tables or tool status) the CPU enables interrupt INT2 (M2 TXIRQ) and sends the
requested data via the 16 bit data bus to U5, Mode 2 encoder logic.  U5 converts the data from
parallel to serial format and the U5 6408 Harris Manchester equivalent encoder, encodes
MD2 BZO data and MD2 BOO data. Data is then sent to line driver (U1).  Data is then transformer
coupled to the WTS buss via T1.  Whenever the U5 data buffer is empty, U5 generates an
interrupt (M2 TXIRQ); and the CPU sends the next word.
Mode 5 and Mode 7 DMA Control:  The equivalent of two 6409 Harris Manchesters have been
incorporated into Actel (U5) for Mode 5 and Mode 7 data transmission. Mode 5 or Mode 7 data is
transmitted using DMA channel 0 (DRQ0).  SMD57 DRQ (See Figure 5) selects which mode will
provide the DMA request.  When SMD57 DRQ is set to ‘0’ Mode 5 uses DMA channel 0
controlled by MD57 DRQ. When SMD57 DRQ is set to ‘1’ Mode 7 uses DMA channel 0
controlled by MD57 DRQ.  SMD57 DRQ is set by firmware in response to the MAP command sent
from the Surface.
Mode 5 Transmit Data:  On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit Mode 5 data the
CPU enables DMA channel 0 and writes the requested data via the 16 bit data bus to U5, Mode 5
encoder logic.  The data is converted from parallel to serial format by U5.  Serial data is received
by the U5 6409 Harris Manchester equivalent encoder and the encoded data (BZO5 and BOO5) is
sent to line driver U3.  Mode 5 data is then transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T3.
Whenever the data buffer is empty, MD57 DRQ is active; and the CPU writes the next data word
via the 16 bit data bus to U5.
Mode 7 Transmit Data:  On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit Mode 7 data the
CPU enables DMA channel 0 and writes the requested data via the 16 bit data bus to U5. The data
is converted from parallel to serial format by U5.  Serial data is received by the U5 6409 Harris
Manchester equivalent encoder and the encoded data (BZO7 and BOO7) is sent to line driver U4.
Mode 7 data is then transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T4.  Whenever the data buffer is
empty, MD57 DRQ is active; and the CPU writes the next data word via the 16 bit data bus to U5.
The CPU is also capable of sending Mode 5 and Mode 7 simultaneously. Mode 5 data is sent
using DMA channel 0 (MD57 DRQ) and Mode 7 data is interrupt driven using MD57 IRQ (INT0).
Simultaneously transmission of data is currently used only when sending Subset E.
3.4.3
SYNCHRONOUS SERIAL TRANSMIT/RECEIVE LOGIC
The CPU board has three synchronous serial communication interfaces with external peripheral
devices.
Two of these serial links are used to transfer data back and forth to the two DSP boards.  These
two serial links consist of a common serial clock (SCLK). The clock speed is set by firmware.  A
clock speed of 4 MHz is used for acquisition, while a clock speed of 1 MHz is used for
programming the DSP flash PROMs. Each of these serial links has a transmit-frame sink (TFS_x)
for beginning and ending a transmission, and a data transmit (DT_x) line for transmission of data
to the two DSP boards (i.e. tables, commands, etc.).  Each of these serial links also has a receive-
frame sink (RFS_x) and a data receive (DR_x) line for receiving data from the two DSP boards.
U5 provides the 4 MHz synchronous serial 1 and 2 transmit logic along with two 4 MHz
synchronous serial receive channels.
The mandrel serial link uses three lines to control the transfer of data.  This serial link is used for
control of transmitter, receiver, and gain selections in the mandrel. U5 provides the logic for the
100 KHz mandrel-synchronous-serial-transmit channel.
A description of the synchronous serial transmit / receive logic follows.

Reference Drawing 194749-100.
The master and slave concept arose while trying to keep all the eight DSP channels synchronized
yet independent.  To avoid a complicated board design to implement this concept the idea was
applied at the chassis level.  The DSP chassis connectors contain address jumpers that set the
master and slave relationship.

The following list explains differences in the chassis wiring, refer to drawing 194749-100:
1.  Connector pin D11-3 (M/S) is grounded by joining it with pin D11-18 (DGND).

The M/S signal is taken by the DSP board as a channel address bit.  Two other bits are
hardwired on each channel during assembly.  On the DSP board that mates with connector
D11, the M/S signal is zero (grounded), the channel addresses then range from “000” to
“011”, making this the master board.  Note, that connector D11 is on the same side as the
CPU board.

2.  Connector pin D21-3 (M/S) is left unconnected.

The M/S signal on the DSP board is pulled up to +5 V.  When the DSP board plugs into
connector D21, the M/S signal remains at +5 V (high).  Thus, the channel addresses range from
“100” to “111”, making this the slave board.

3.  Connector pin D21-17 (B_AD TRIG OUT) is not wired.

The B_AD TRIG OUT signal is the sampling clock generated by both DSP boards, but the
master board’s B_AD TRIG OUT signal is the only one used.

4.  Connector pin D11-17 (B_AD TRIG OUT) is joined to pin D11-14 (AD_TRIG_IN) and
D21-14 (AD_TRIG_IN).

The AD_TRIG_IN signal is used by the boards to create the trigger signals for the A/Ds.
B_AD TRIG OUT signal from the ‘Master’ board is used to drive the AD_TRIG_IN of both
the boards.  This keeps the A/Ds of all eight channels synchronized."

GRESET/ is an output of Xilinx FPGA (U8).  Xilinx FPGA outputs GRESET/ based on the inputs
from three separate sources.  Only one source at a time can be selected to control GRESET/ on the
DSP board.  This is accomplished by soldering a 0 Ohm resistor (R1 or R2 or R3) between the
source and Xilinx FPGA’s PROGRAM/ pin (U8-74).  Note that only one of the three resistors

FPGA (XILINX U8)
The Xilinx FPGA incorporates several logic functions described below.
4.5.1
GRESET/ SIGNAL
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and 193336-100.
The reset signal enters the Xilinx FPGA at PROGRAM/ (U8-74).  This causes the Xilinx FPGA to
go into a reset mode.  The FPGA outputs a low on Greset/ (U8-44) resetting DSP Channels
(e.g.U10), until the Xilinx FPGA downloads the program from the Xilinx PROM (U5).
Additionally, logic is added to the GRESET/ (U8-44) so that after power-up or a CPU reset the
DSP channels can be reset again (if needed) without resetting the Xilinx FPGA.  RESET/ (J1-3)
from the CPU comes into Xilinx from another pin (U8-87) and is wired to GRESET/ through an
AND gate.  The other input of the AND gate is controlled by the first DSP (U10).  When the DSPs
want to load the acquisition firmware (193338-000), the first DSP writes to I/O address 2 which
prompts the FPGA to reset the DSPs and clear the A16 bit to the DSP PROMs.  The DSPs are
reset for about 1 ms; then the DSPs load the acquisition firmware from the DSP PROMs.

4.5.2
M/S SIGNAL
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and 193336-100.
The master/slave signal enters the board through the connector, J1-3 (M/S), and is inverted by the
driver, U3-10 (BM/S).  BM/S is then inverted again by Xilinx FPGA, M/S* (U8-68) to return it to
it’s original state.  This signal is used internally and is sent to the DSPs.
4.5.3
BUSY SIGNAL
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and 193336-100.
The CPU board monitors the output busy signal (BBUSY_OUT/, J1-15) from the DSP board and
sends commands only when the DSP channels are not busy.  The output busy signal is made up of
individual busy signals from each DSP channel and an input busy signal (BUSY_IN, J1-4).  The
input busy signal is pulled up on the DSP board to avoid a floating driver input if the CPU side of
this connector pin is not wired.
The Xilinx FPGA ANDs the input busy signal with the master/slave signal.  Then the output of the
AND-gate is summed with all of the channel-busy signals to produce the output busy signal.
Note, that the input busy signal for the master DSP board is the sum of the busy signals
from the channels of the slave DSP board.  For the slave DSP board, the input busy signal
(when ANDed with the master/slave signal) is ignored.
SERIAL PORT SIGNALS
Reference Drawing 193334-100  and 193336-100.
The serial port signals coming from the CPU board are simply inverted inside the Xilinx FPGA.
The serial clock (B(1)SCLK, U8-77), receive frame sync (B(2)RFS, U8-78), and receive data
(B(3)DR, U8-79) are inverted to counter the effect of the driver (U3 and U4).  The serial clock is
split in two: SCLKB (U8-115) to channels 1 (U10) and 2 (U18), and SCLKA (U8-116) to
channels 3 (U26) and 4 (U34), respectively.  CMD*/ (U8-122) is generated in the FPGA from the
receive frame sync. It provides an interrupt to the DSP(s) indicating the beginning of the data
transmission from the CPU.  This is important because the channels’ DSPs need to know in
advance whether the information being shifted into their receive registers is a command or data.

MAY 2001
For the serial port signals from the Channels to the CPU board, the Transmit Frame Sync (U8-129
to 132) of all the Channels are AND-ed together.  The Transmit Data of each Channel (U8-133 to
136) is AND-ed with the inverted Transmit Frame Sync of that Channel and then all outputs are
OR-ed together.  This is done to prevent noise from other Channels to interfere with the Channel
that is transmitting data back to the CPU.  For example, if Channel one is sending data to the CPU,
the Transmit Frame Sync of the other Channels will be high and therefore the Transmit Data from
the other Channels will be ignored.  All the Transmit Frame Sync signals are pulled high inside the
FPGA, to avoid problems due to floating Frame Sync signals.  Figure 18 shows data being
transmitted to the CPU board.  Note, only one DSP transmit at a time.

4.5.5
A/D TIMER
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and 193336-100.
The A/D trigger clock is selected by the CPU board.  In the Acquisition Firmware, the sampling
clock parameter in the DSP Parameter Table dictates the period of the trigger clock, if non-filter
mode is selected.  If the filter mode is on, in the Acquisition Firmware, then a fixed period trigger
clock of 8us width is generated.  Note, in the Diagnostic Firmware, the trigger clock is fixed
9us wide and can’t be changed.

The first DSP (U10) latches the trigger clock period into the FPGA through I/O address 0.  This
initiates an internal counter counting down inside the FPGA running on a 1 MHz clock.  When the
counter ends the count, a low pulse 1 us wide is generated.  The counter gets loaded again from the
latch and begin another count down.  Note, only the first DSP on the DSP board is capable of
writing the trigger clock period into Xilinx FPGA.  The trigger clock is free running once
initialized.  The FPGA keeps generating it, which means the A/D keeps converting signal to digital
data, until a trigger clock period of 0us is latched into the FPGA.

4.5.6
A/D SEQUENCER
Reference Drawing 193334-100, 193336-100 and Figure 14.
The A/D trigger clock (AD_TRIG_IN, J1-14) that comes into the board is used by the Xilinx
FPGA to generate a chip select signal (CS/) and a run-convert signal (R/C/) that is fed to each
Channel’s A/D through individual FPGA pins.  For example, CS1 A/ is the select signal and
R/C1 A/ is the run-convert signal for Channel 1’s A/D.  These signals start the A/D conversion.
The timing of these signal’s active edges relative to each other and their widths are important to
initiate a successful conversion.  Figure 20 gives important timing and pulse width information.
The DSPs assert the CS/ signal through the FPGA when the DSPs are reading the converted data
from it’s A/D.  The R/C/ signal stays high (inactive) at this time.  The DSPs activate the CS/ signal
by doing an I/O read.  This causes the IOMS/ signal (e.g. IOMS1/) to go low (active) and the
FPGA then asserts the CS/ signal.  The A/D responds to this by outputting the data on the data
bus.  For the first DSP on the DSP board, the FPGA also looks at the RD/ signal.  This is done to
avoid generating a CS/ signal when the first DSP is writing the trigger clock period into the FPGA
(also an I/O operation involving IOMS/).

4.5.7
A/D INTERRUPT
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and 193336-100.
The DSPs need to read their A/D’s data once it’s converted.  Thus, the A/Ds indicate the end of
conversion to the DSPs through the A/Ds’ busy signal (e.g. U12-26).  The busy signal
(ADBUSY1, U8-32) goes through the FPGA into DSPs’ interrupt pin (e.g. IRQ2-1/, U10-38).
The FPGA NORs the busy signal with a mask (AD_BUSY_MASK).  The mask blocks the status
of the A/D busy signal if the command to generate a fire pulse is received.  This prevents the DSPs
from responding to any false interrupts which may happen as the fire pulse takes minimum one
trigger clock pulse before becoming synchronized.  The following figure, Figure 22 shows the
internal signal mask created when the fire pulse command is issued.

4.5.8
FIRE PULSE LOGIC
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and 193336-100.
The DSP board (‘Master’ DSP board) creates the fire pulse for the XMAC II Transmitter.  When
the DSP board receives the command from the CPU board to acquire data, it issues a command to
the FPGA to generate a fire pulse.  The fire pulse is synchronized with the B_AD_TRIG_IN to
synchronize the A/D with the fire pulse.  A mask is created to prevent false DSP A/D interrupts
until the fire is synchronized.  The fire pulse is passed out to the CPU board through connector pin
J1-5 (BFIRE).
Note, fire pulse is created by both the DSP board in the 1677 EA tool, but only the fire pulse
of the Master DSP board reaches the CPU board.

DSPs (ANALOG DEVICES U10, U18, U26, U34)
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and Figure 14.
The DSP, as mentioned earlier, is the brain of the DSP Channel (see Figure 14).  This part is
responsible for collecting the signal as digitized data and processing it.  All the DSP commands
and signals, except for a few, goes to the other parts in the DSP Channel through the Xilinx FPGA
(U8).  The DSP shares the data bus with the DSP PROM and A/D.  For more information some
topics related to the DSPs are organized below into separate sections.
4.6.1
DSP’S PROM
The DSP PROM contains two independent programs.  The DSP PROM 128 Kbytes in size, is split
into two 64 Kbytes sections by controlling the most significant address bit (A16).  A16 is
controlled by the Xilinx FPGA (U8).  The section of the PROM that has the lower memory
addresses (0x0000 - 0x0 FFFF) contains the Acquisition Firmware and the section that has the
higher memory address (0x1000 - 0x1 FFFF) contains the Diagnostic Firmware.
The Diagnostic Firmware is burned into the DSP PROM at the time of board assembly.  The
Acquisition Firmware is programmed later at the time of board testing.
When the DSP power up, it loads the Diagnostic Firmware because A16 is set by the FPGA.  The
Diagnostic Firmware checks the programming jumper J8, if J8 is jumped than the first DSP
commands the FPGA to clear A16 and reset the DSPs to force a program reload.
If J8 is not jumped A16 is still cleared but the DSP is not reloaded and stays in Diagnostic Mode.
A16 is cleared so that the lower memory section of the DSP PROM is available in Diagnostic
Mode for programming if needed.  Figures 25 and 26 illustrates this process.

DSP’S A/D
The timings and the trigger signals of the A/D are discussed in previous sections from the point of
view of Xilinx FPGA (U8) and DSPs (see section 4.5.5 through 4.5.7).  Therefore, these topics are
not repeated here.  The figure below shows the timing and signals required by the A/D.

The figure below shows the input signal and the equivalent digitized A/D value.
The figure above has two important abbreviations, AD for A/D data in hex and IS for Input Signal
coming into the DSP board.  The OPAMP gains the Input Signal by 2 and feeds it to the A/D.
Therefore a 5 V Input Signal reaches the A/D input as a 10 V signal.
The figure shows 2 circles.  The inner circle is the A/D’s range shown in voltage from the data
sheet.  The outer circle shows the input signal voltage and its A/D equivalent.  The A/D hex value
range for positive voltages starting from the smaller value is 0x0000 to 0x7 FFF and the value
range for negative voltages starting again from smaller value is 0xFFFF to 0x8000.  Here is a list

CHANNEL #1’S DSP VERSUS OTHER CHANNELS’ DSPs
Reference Drawing 193334-100 and 193336-100.
The first DSP is special compared to the other three DSPs on the DSP board in a few ways.

Fire Pulse

no access or control over fire

The difference listed in the table above are described in detail below:
4.6.3.1 DSP WIRING
Only the first DSP has it’s write (WR1/, U8-41) and read (D1_RD1/, U8-42) signals and second
address bit (D1_A1, U8-30) connected to the Xilinx FPGA (U8).  This allows the first DSP to do
an I/O write or read into the FPGA.  The other DSPs have address bit A0 going into the FPGA like
the first DSP, but unlike the first DSP, these address bits A0 are not used.
4.6.3.2 DSP PROM A16 BIT & DSP RESET
Because each of the DSPs have identical firmware installed they all respond to common
commands such as GO and FIRE.  However, only the first DSp is wired to the FPGA and can
effect the required change.
When the DSPs power-up into Diagnostic Mode, only the first DSP on the DSP board, on
checking the programming jumper J8 condition, has the capability to request the FPGA to clear
A16 and reset all the DSPs.  If the DSPs have to stays in Diagnostic Mode, only the first DSP has
the capability to clear A16 without resetting the DSPs.  Even when the GO command is issued to
the DSPs, all the DSPs wait in a wait loop to be reset by the first DSP through the FPGA.
4.6.3.3 TRIGGER CLOCK
Once again the first DSP can write the trigger clock into the FPGA and the other DSPs can’t.  This
operation occurs as an I/O write into the FPGA.
4.6.3.4 FIRE PULSE
The fire pulse is requested by all the DSPs during acquisition, but only the first DSP is able to
latch the request because it is the only DSP wired to the FPGA."

1677EA-XMAC-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 1.1 ACQUISITION TIMING EXAMPLE - STACK OF 1,"ACQUISITION TIMING EXAMPLE - STACK OF 1
Reference Figure 2.
A typical XMACII subset 6 acquisition cycle using a stack of 1 is shown in figure 2.  Subset 6
acquires 3 subcycles.  The first subcycle is a full wave monopole acquiring 330 words of data per
channel (8 channels).  The second subcycle is a inline dipole acquiring 300 words of data per
channel (8 channels).  The third is a delta T acquiring 100 words of data per channel (4 channels).
The following is a step by step description of the sequence of events that take place.
1.  Ten bytes of mandrel parameters (i.e. transmitter selection, receiver selection, and gains) are
transmitted to the mandrel by the CPU, via a 100 KHz synchronous serial communications
link.
2.  Next 26 words of DSP parameters (i.e. sample rate, start time, #of words to acquire, etc.) are
sent to all eight DSPs simultaneously by the CPU, via a 4 MHz synchronous serial
communications link.  The first word of the parameter table contains the command, address,
and number of words.  The first word (in this case) would be hex “5 F1 A,” where 5 is the
command “LOAD TABLE,” F is the universal address, and 1 A is the number of words.  For
more information on DSP commands, tables, etc., see Section 15 in the repair/maintenance
procedures of this manual.
3.  Once the DSPs have received the parameters the CPU sends a single acquire/process
command to all eight DSPs simultaneously.
4.  DSP number 1 synchronizes the trigger clock then sends a fire pulse.  The fire pulse is sent
back to the CPU board, then through a level shifter and on to the transmitter.  Note:  The
DSPs acquire data for 25 msec but only process and transmit data per the acquisition
parameters.
5.  After 36 msec the CPU transmits the next subcycle mandrel parameters.  This allows time for
the switching of the gains and receivers to settle before the beginning of the next subcyle
acquisition.
6.  After 44 msec the CPU begins to request and receive header data from each DSP (1 word of
max amplitude and 1 word of time of max amplitude). Asking for data at 44 msec of a 50
msec subcycle allows all data to be collected before the end of the 50 msec’s.
7.  When the CPU is finished receiving header data it begins requesting and receiving channel
data from each DSP.  Because there are two separate 4 MHz receive serial communications
links (one per DSP board), two channels of data can be transmitted simultaneously.
8.  When the 50 msec subcycle length is reached, the process begins again with Step 2 (above)
until all subcyles have been acquired."

Note: Regulator U4 (not installed) and its associated components are not used at this time.
Transformer T1 steps-down the nominal 180 VAC cablehead voltage to levels suitable for the
required outputs.  The cablehead voltage is applied to T1's primary via the terminal board
(162758-000) and the 32 pin block.  Two center-tapped secondaries on T1 provide the stepped-
down AC voltages for three rectifier/ripple filter circuits.
Unregulated ±34 VDC is provided to the power supply PCB (193330-000) from T1's first
secondary winding via bridge rectifier BR1 and chokes L1 A and L1 B.  Likewise, unregulated
+16 VDC is provided to the PCB from T1's last secondary winding via BR2 and L2.  Each choke's
winding with its respective filter capacitor(s) on the power supply PCB is a choke input ripple
filter.  The ripple filter averages the 120 Hz pulsating dc received from the bridge rectifiers before
application to the regulator circuits.
Unregulated power is applied to the power supply PCB via connector PS1.  Each of the three
unregulated inputs is filtered by a polarized capacitor(s) or banks of polarized capacitors: C1, C2,
C9-C13, and C18-C20.  Each unregulated input is also applied to the input pin of its respective
three terminal regulator IC, U1-U3.
The regulators reduce and ""regulate-down"" the unregulated input voltage to its required output
voltage and, in the process, attenuate any 120 Hz input ripple passed through the input filters.
Output short-circuit protection and overload protection are provided by the regulator ICs.  Diodes
D1-D6 provide reverse-voltage protection for the regulator ICs and polarized capacitors.
Capacitors C5-C8, C14, and C15, across the regulated output lines, serve to minimize output
voltage transients during load changes and maintain a low power supply output impedance at
higher frequencies.  Capacitors C3, C4 and C15 across the regulator's inputs serve to ensure the
regulator ""sees"" a low impedance at high frequency.

The serial data of DR_1 is shifted into two 8-bit serial-in, parallel-out shift registers on the positive
edge of SCLK when RFS_1 frame signal is active (high).  The Actel (U5) inverts DR_1 before it
is shifted into the shift registers. A 16 bit counter and flip flop are used to latch the data into two 8-
bit latches.  The flip flop is also used to indicate to the CPU that data has been received
(S1 RXDRQ).  The flip flop is reset when the CPU reads the data.  The S1 RXDRQ signal is
connected to the CPU DRQ1 signal.

Reference Drawing 194749-100, 193334-100  and Figure 1.
The 1677 EA instrument requires two DSP boards as shown in Figure 1.  Each DSP board contains
four DSP channels.  The DSP boards are identical, but functionality is determined by their
physical position.  The DSP board on the same side as the CPU is considered the master DSP
board; and the other is designated the slave DSP board.  The reason for this distinction is described
in section 4.1 “MASTER BOARD VERSUS SLAVE BOARD.”
Both DSP boards are connected on one end to the CPU board through separate connectors (D11
and D21). On the other end, the DSP boards are connected to the 45 pin acoustic buss (bottom
sub, J2) through separate coaxial cables (J17, J19, J111, J113 and J27, J29, J211, J213).
The connector on the CPU side provides DC power, reset and serial communication signals
between the CPU and the DSP boards, and some signals between the ‘Master’ and the ‘Slave’
DSP boards.  The coaxial cables from the 45 pin bottom sub bring signals from the 1678 MB
XMAC II Receiver.
The DSP Channel numbering starts from the ‘Master’ DSP board and ends with the ‘Slave’ DSP
board.  Thus the DSP Channels, as shown in Figure 1, are labeled Channel #1 through Channel
#8.  Each Channel is directly addressable by the CPU board during acquisition.

5.  Connector pin CP2-20 (BBUSY/) is connected to pin D11-15 (BBUSY_OUT).

The CPU board checks BBUSY/ to monitor the status of all eight DSP Channels.
BBUSY_OUT is the status of all channels on the master board and BUSY_IN summed up.
BUSY_IN brings the status of the four Channels from the slave board.  Refer to Figure 16.

6.  Connector pin D11-4 (BUSY_IN) is connected to pin D21-15 (BBUSY_OUT) and Connector
pin D21-4 (BUSY_IN) is a no-connect.

The BBUSY_OUT signal on a DSP board is the sum of the BUSYs of all channels on that
board and BUSY_IN.  On the slave board, the BUSY_IN signal is not wired; therefore, the
BBUSY_OUT signal on this board is only the sum of all its four channels.

7.  Connector pin D11-5 (BFIRE) is connected to pin CP2-18 (BFIRE/).  Connector pin D21-5

The bottom WTS sub must have the 45 pin bulkhead (item 4) installed into the WTS bottom sub
housing (item 5) making sure proper O-Rings (items 11) have been seated correctly.  The bulkhead
insertion tool is used to align the keyed bulkhead while drawing it into the sub housing by turning the
sub with a pin wrench.  Once the bulkhead has been inserted completely the snap ring (item 10) must
be installed into the sub with snap ring pliers making sure the snap ring is seated properly into its
groove.  Finally the outer O-Rings (items 4) must be seated into their respective O-Ring grooves with
proper lubrication.
The thermal expansion unit is housed in the WTS top sub which is installed by first setting the spring
(item 4) inside the WTS top sub housing.  This procedure is followed by setting the travel sleeve
(item 3) into the center of the spring.  The retainer ring (item 5) is set over the travel sleeve with the
countersink hole facing upward.  While compressing the spring, 3 flat head socket screws (items 6)
are used to secure the ring.  The hole pattern for this retainer ring allows it to be installed in only one
alignment configuration.  The split collar (item 2) should now be secured around the throat of the sub
housing (item 1) by first coating the throat with lubricant, and then securing the collar with socket
head screws.  Finally, the O-Rings for the outer nose (items 9) as well as for the O-Rings at the back
of the sub (items 10) should be installed using proper lubricant."

The subs are assembled and the threads are lubricated, the lower sub should be installed first using a
pin wrench to rotate the sub while securing the housing with a strap wrench.  The electronics (item
3) is now inserted into the housing (item 2) with the keyed snout end going in first and the pigtail at
the opposite end last. Once the electronics are against the bottom of the housing the 1/4-20 T-Handle
wrench is screwed into the bulkhead on the pigtail end and then the instrument is twisted while
pushing inward until it keys up with the bottom sub.  The keyed snout on the electronics should align
with the timing marks on the housing and subs which will aide in installation.  The top sub is now
ready to be installed by first feeding the pigtail in through the throat of the top sub.  Once the pigtail is
through, it should be held with slight tension while the sub is screwed into the housing. The 32-pin
block (item 15) is connected to the pigtail and carefully twisted back into the throat of the WTS top
sub while seating the block into the sub itself.  The retainer clip (item 14) is then seated into the
locked groove to secure the block.  Thread protectors for the top (item 7) and the bottom (item 8)
are installed to protect and aid in handling of the instrument."

connected to the pigtail.  The block is disconnected from the pigtail and the WTS top sub may be
removed with an open end wrench while securing the housing with a strap wrench.  Removal of the
electronics may now be accomplished by screwing the 1/4-20 T-Handle into the bulkhead and sliding

VISUAL CHECKOUT
1. Verify all components are properly installed.
2. Visually inspect both the 1677 EA DSP P.C. boards (P/N 193334-000). Examine P.C. boards for
broken capacitors, contaminants between printed circuit traces, and open or shorted traces.
3. If all the preceding checks fail to uncover any potential problems, proceed with the next section.
14.3.2
DSP BOARD POWER ON TEST
1. Power down the tool, if the tool-power is not already turned off.
2. Reconnect all P.C. board connectors if they were previously disconnected.
3.  Setup a sine wave generator like HP 3310 A Function Generator or similar near the bottom
connector (J2) of the tool.  Set the output function to sine wave, frequency knob to 500 Hz, and
output voltage to 3 Vp-p with 0 V dc.
4. Chain together 8 discrete male pins and plug them into connector (J2) pins 19, 20, 21, 22, 33, 34,
35, and 36.  Make a second chain and connect connector (J2) pins 18, 37, and 45.  Connect sine
wave generator output to pin 19 and generator ground to pin 18.  See drawing 194749-100.
5. Connect an ECLIPS-C or ECLIPS-S Acquisition System and 3510 XA or 3514 XA to the 1677 EA
using cable assembly 148986-000 and quick change connectors.  When using an ECLIPS-S
Acquisition System it is recommended that a wireline be used in place of a dummy line.
6. On the ECLIPS-C or ECLIPS-S load an XMACII OCT that contains subset 6.  Example OCT 833.
Refer to XMACII Instrument Operating Instructions in the ECLIPS Instrument Operating
Manual.
7. Apply 180±5 V rms power using the ECLIPS to monitor cable head voltage.
8. On the DSP P.C. boards check the voltage at +5 VD1 referenced to GND1 to make sure +5 V±5%
is present.  If this step passes continue to next step otherwise disconnect the D11 and D21
connectors and check the +5 V power supply on D11-8 and D21-8 referenced to D11-18 and D21-
18 respectively.  If it is not there, check the 1677 EA power supply, otherwise there is a short on
the board(s).  Check all ICs and possible shorts on the board(s).
9. Using the ECLIPS-C or ECLIPS-S Acquisition System establish Mode 2 communication with the
3510 or 3514 and establish Mode 5 communication with the 1677 EA.  Open XMACII:STATUS,
XMACII:MONOPOLE TOOL CONTROL, and XMACII:DIPOLE TOOL CONTROL windows
from the TOOL menu.  Set STACKING to ""1"" in both XMACII:MONOPOLE TOOL CONTROL
and XMACII:DIPOLE TOOL CONTROL windows.  Select DOWNLOAD to download the tool
ACQUIRE STATUS button and observe the DSP errors.
14.3.3
DSP BOARD TROUBLESHOOTING

Locate paragraph that most accurately describes the symptoms and follow the suggested
troubleshooting procedure.
1. If sine waves are not observed on all of the channels and none of the DSP error bits are set in the
Status window.

Probable cause:
Connection between the sine wave generator and connector (J2) or the coaxial
connectors to the DSP boards.
Action:
Check that the output of the sine wave generator is connected to channel 1
through 8 on connector (J2).  Also verify the connectors J17, J19, J111, J113,
J27, J29, J211, and J213, are plugged into the DSP boards.  Refer to drawing
194749-100.

Probable cause:
Connection between DSP board 1 (DSP1, see 194749-100) B_AD TRIG OUT
to DSP boards (DSP1 and DSP2) AD_TRIG_IN.
Action:
Connect D11-17 (DSP1, B_AD TRIG OUT) to D11-14 (DSP1,
AD_TRIG_IN) and D21-14 (DSP2, AD_TRIG_IN).  See drawing 194749-
100.

2. If sine waves are not observed on all of the channels and the Status window has any or all DSP
error bits set.

Probable cause:
DSP boards are not in acquisition mode.
Action:
Check if the DSP boards have J8 buss-wired. See scope pictures 14.3.3 and
14.3.4.  Buss-wire J8 if it’s not jumped.

Probable cause:
DSP PROMs (U11, U19, U27, U35) of both DSP boards are not programmed.
See schematic 193334-100.
Action:
Compare scope picture 14.3.4 with 14.3.5, 14.3.7 with 14.3.8, and see scope
picture 14.3.11.  Refer to in-circuit DSP PROM programming procedure
193334-856 to program the DSP PROM.

Probable cause:
The interface between the DSP and CPU boards is broken.
Action:
Check the receiver side of the serial interface between the DSP and CPU
boards to make sure the commands are making it to the DSP’s by checking the
wires between CP2-5 and D11-1, CP2-15 and D21-1,  CP2-6 and D11-11,
CP2-16 and D21-11, CP2-7 and D11-2, CP2-17 and D21-2, and by probing
points on the DSP boards, see scope picture(s) 14.3.12 through 14.3.15.

7.0 INSULATION / CONTINUITY CHECKOUT ‡






NOTE
All insulation/continuity checks are to be done in the relative mode on the
ohmmeter.  This will null out any resistance due to the test leads.  After deducting
test lead resistance, continuity is defined as less than 0.1Ω.  Open (∞ Ω) is defined
as greater than 100 MΩ.

For the following checks refer to the electronics assembly drawing 194749-000 and
the wiring diagram 194749-100.

10.0 CPU / COMMUNICATION CHECKOUT ‡
NOTE
This section checks operation of the CPU Board P/N 193325-000 while checking telemetry
integrity.  Refer to the Troubleshooting section for the CPU board to troubleshoot the board itself.

Verify  DS2 (Red LED) and DS3 (Green LED) are ‘On’.  If both LED’s are ‘On’ the CPU has
initialized properly and is waiting for a command.  Proceed to the next step.  If either of the
LED’s are ‘Off’ refer to Troubleshooting section for the CPU board to troubleshoot the board
itself.

Using the ECLIPS-C or ECLIPS-S Acquisition System establish Mode 2 communication with
the 3510 XA or 3514 XA.

Using the ECLIPS-C or ECLIPS-S Acquisition System establish Mode 5 communication with
the 1677 EA.  If communication with the 1677 EA cannot be established refer to the
Troubleshooting section for the CPU board to troubleshoot the board itself.

Once communications is established select TOOL then XMACII: STATUS to bring up the
XMACII STATUS window. Starting at TOOL SERIES select each button.  The expected
results are shown in figure 1. Note:  For a full description of XMACII STATUS refer to
the Appendices of this document.

Next select TOOL then XMACII:MONOPOLE TOOL TABLE to bring up the MONOPOLE
TOOL TABLE window.  Download a TOOL TABLE for subset 6.  NOTE: After the tool
CHECKSUM for the results of the table download. The expected results are shown in Figure
2.  If you do not get the expected results try adjusting wts mode 2 transmit gain.  If it still
does not work refer to the Troubleshooting section for the CPU board to troubleshoot the
board itself.

Next turn the Switch ACT for subset 6 ‘ON’.  The green LED (DS3) should be blinking.  This
LED is like a heart beat, when the tool enters an acquisition cycle the LED is turned on, when
the tool exits an acquisition cycle the LED is turned off.  If the LED is not blinking refer to the

Avoid thermal shocks.

Place the 1677 EA electronics (without housing) into oven. Care must be given to support
the chassis.  Connect signal generator per step 11.2 and 11.3 with high temp wires long
enough to keep signal generator outside of the oven.

Connect an ECLIPS-C or ECLIPS-S Acquisition System and 3510 XA or 3514 XA to the
1677 EA using cable assembly 148986-000 and quick change connectors.  When using an
ECLIPS-S Acquisition System it is recommended that a wireline be used in place of a
dummy line.  See Appendices section 15.10 through 15.12 for optional set-ups and
cable information.

On the ECLIPS system load an XMACII OCT that contains subset 6.  Example OCT 833.
Refer to XMACII Instrument Operating Instructions in the ECLIPS Instrument Operating
Guide.

Apply 180 ±5 Vrms power while monitoring the current indicated by the AC current meter
of the 2061 power supply or equivalent.  At no time should the current exceed 270 mA.
If the current exceeds 270 mA immediately turn tool-power off and troubleshoot to determine

5. On the CPU P.C. board check the voltage at TP13 (+5 V) referenced to TP14 (DGND) to make
sure +5 V ±5% is present. If this step passes continue to next step otherwise disconnect the CP1
connector and check the +5 V power supply on CP1-1 referenced to CP1-3 of the P.C. board
connector. If it is not there, check the 1677 EA power supply, otherwise there is a short on the
board.  Check all ICs and possible shorts on the board.

6. When 180 Vrms is applied to the instrument or when the instrument is reset using Tool Re-Init the
two LED’s DS2 (Red) and DS3 (Green) should be on.  This indicates that the CPU has initialized
O.K. and is waiting for a command.  If these to LED’s are on continue to the CPU Scope pictures
to determine the possible fault. If they are not check the following.

Probable cause:
EPROMS (U9 and U10) are not programmed.

If problem is not found, check the transmit side of the serial interface
between CPU and DSP boards to make certain the data is making it to the
CPU connector by probing points on the DSP boards (see scope picture(s)
14.3.16 through 14.3.18), and check wires D11-16 and CP2-1, D21-16 and
CP2-3, D11-7 and CP2-2, and D21 and CP2-4.  See drawing 194749-100.

3. If first four channels have sine waves but channels 5 through 8 do not and Status window has no
DSP errors.

Probable cause:
B_AD TRIG OUT wire from DSP board 1 (DSP1, see 194749-100) is not
connected to DSP board 2 (DSP2).
Action:
Connect D11-17 (DSP1, B_AD TRIG OUT) to D21-14 (DSP2,
AD_TRIG_IN).  See drawing 194749-100.

Probable cause:
Connection between the sine wave generator and connector (J2) channels 5
through 8 or the coaxial connectors to DSP board 2.
Action:
Check the output of the sine wave generator is connected to channel 5 through
8 on connector (J2).  Also verify the connectors J27, J29, J211, and J213 are
plugged into DSP board 2.  See drawing 194749-100.


4. If first four channels have sine waves but channels 5 through 8 do not and Status window has DSP
errors.
Probable cause:
DSP board 2 is not in acquisition mode.
Action:
Check if the DSP boards have J8 buss-wired. See scope pictures 14.3.4 and
14.3.5.  Buss-wire J8 if it’s not jumped.

Probable cause:
DSP PROMs (U11, U19, U27, U35) of DSP board 2 are not programmed.  See
picture 14.3.11.  Refer to in-circuit DSP PROM programming procedure
193334-856 to program the DSP PROM.

5. If one or two of the channels are not working.

Probable cause:
Connection between the sine wave generator and connector (J2) pin of that
channel or the coaxial connector to DSP board of that channel, if Status
window doesn’t have error bit set.
Action:
Check the output of the sine wave generator is connected to that channel on
connector (J2).  Also verify the coaxial connector of that channel is plugged
into the respective DSP board.  See drawing 194749-100.

Probable cause:
DSP PROM of that channel is not programmed.
Action:
Compare scope picture 14.3.4 with 14.3.5, 14.3.7 with 14.3.8, and see scope
picture 14.3.11.  Refer to in-circuit DSP PROM programming procedure
193334-856 to program the DSP PROM.


6. If sine wave is observed only on the first channel, all the other channels have flat lines and the
Status window has DSP SERIAL CH1 TIMEOUT error bit set.

Probable cause:
DSP board 1 (DSP1) channel 1 is bad.
Action:
Check the DSP chip (U10, see schematic 193334-100) of the first channel
(DSP board 1).  See scope picture 14.3.4, 14.3.5 and 14.3.7 through 14.3.18.
Replace the DSP chip if it has the problem.

Probable cause:
DSP PROM (U11) of DSP board 1 is not programmed.  See schematic

15.14 DSP Firmware Update Procedure


Note: During this procedure all XMACII ACTs must be 'OFF'. The two LEDs on
the CPU board (DS3 (Green) and DS2 (Red)) will be used as an aid.  Refer to
Section 15.14 for additional information regarding LED indications

1.
Load OCT '1667diag', then setup communications on the ECLIPS system.

2.
On the ECLIPS system, select 'TOOL', '1677 EA:DSP ACQUISITION STATUS'.

3.
Select 'ACQUIRE CHANNEL STATUS'.  Verify that the channel status for all 8
channels read '100' or '102'.
Note:
This is the first hint of the DSP acquisition program version and revision.  A
'100' indicates revision XA while a '102' indicates revision XB or A.  Note: XB
and A revisions are identical.  The entire channel status description can be found
in Section 15.6 of this document.

4.
Select 'ACQUIRE PROGRAM VERSION'.  Verify that all eight channels 'ACQ'
version read the same value, indicating that the DSP firmware (flash PROMs) are up-
to-date; continue to the Programming Checkout Procedure.  If any of the 8 channels
'ACQ' version are different then the DSP firmware needs to be updated; continue to the
next step.

5.
Close the '1677 EA:DSP ACQUISITION STATUS' and turn tool power off.

6.
Copy the DSP acquisition program file (193338x.bin, where x is the revision) to the
dat1a/pass directory. Note: make sure that the file name extension is .bin.

7.
On both DSP boards (P/N 193334-000) remove jumper J8. See Figure 10 for J8
location. The easiest way to do this is to simply cut it with a pair of cutters.  Be sure
that the buss wire is not touching after being cut.

8.
Apply 180 ±5 Vrms tool power.

9.
Before continuing turn 'OFF' any ACT associated with the 1677 EA/XMACII.
This will prevent any overwriting of the DSP program in the tool buffer.

10.
Select 'TOOL', '1667 EA:DSP DIAGNOSTIC CONTROL'.  This window is used for
DSP diagnostics and programming the DSP flash PROMs.  The window has been setup
in a sequential selection order.  In other words, select the commands in the order that
they appear in the window. If everything is okay, continue to the next command.

11.
Select 'ACQUIRE SERIAL STATUS'.  If both channels are okay continue to next step.
If either channel has an error resolve the problem before continuing.  First verify J8 is
out, if it is not it will cause an error on both serial channels.  Refer to Section 14.0 of
this document for further trouble shooting."
1677EA-XMAC-AMO,Repair/Maintenance Procedures - REPAIR MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES,"82


1677 EA 8 CH ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS


P/N 130802-956
MAY 2008
12.
Select 'ACQUIRE CHANNEL STATUS'.  If channel status for all eight
channels read '0' continue to the next step. If bit eight is set (i.e. 1xx) then J8 is
not out and the DSP boards are not in the diagnostic mode.  Remove J8 and
check status again.  Resolve the problem before continuing.

13.
Select 'SELECT DSP PROGRAM FILE'.  This will be the program file that was
copied to dat1a/pass in step 6.  Note: make sure that the file name extension
is .bin.

14.
The following is useful information.  The next step is to download the file to the
CPU buffer (Tool buffer).  The file is a fixed 64 K bytes in size.  The ECLIPS
system downloads the file in 2 K byte increments using Mode 2. After each 2 K
bytes are downloaded the ECLIPS system automatically uploads it and
compares it.  If it is o.k. the next 2 K bytes are downloaded and so on.  If it is
not o.k. the ECLIPS system will try to download and compare one more time.
If the second time fails the ECLIPS system will abort.  If this happens try
adjusting Mode 2 and Transmit settings then try downloading again.  When
complete the 'SELECT CHANNEL(S) TO FLASH BUTTON' 'ALL' will be
sensitized as an indication of a successful download. If all works the first time
it takes approximately 2 minutes to download.

15.
Select 'DOWNLOAD TO TOOL BUFFER'.  While the download is progressing
the green LED will be 'ON' and the red LED will change transitions on each 2 K-
byte download.  This can help indicate that the download is in process.  When
the download is complete the 'SELECT CHANNEL(S) TO FLASH BUTTON'
'ALL' is sensitized, the red LED is 'OFF' and the green LED is 'ON'.

16.
After downloading is complete select 'SELECT CHANNEL(S) TO FLASH
BUTTON' 'ALL'.

17.
Select 'WRITE TO DSP FLASH' this will program all eight DSP Flash PROMs
via the two serial ports (Note this is why the serial status was checked in step
11).  Do not do anything else to the tool while programming is in process.
The green LED will be 'OFF' and the red LED will be 'ON' indicating that the
Flash PROMs are being programmed.  A successful programming process takes
approximately seven minutes.

18.
When the red LED goes 'OFF' and the green LED goes 'ON' programming is
complete.  Continue to the next step to find out if the programming was a
success.

19.
Select 'ACQUIRE PROGRAM STATUS'; if all eight channels read ok
programming was a success - go to step 23.

20. If any channel indicates an error it must be reprogrammed. Select 'SELECT
CHANNEL(S) TO FLASH BUTTON', 'CH X', where X is the channel to be
programmed.  Note: If all channels had errors then go back to step 17."

21.
Next select 'WRITE TO DSP FLASH' to program the DSP channel that was selected.
This process takes about 45 seconds.  The LED response is the same as in steps 17
and 18.

22.
Select 'ACQUIRE PROGRAM STATUS' if all 8 channels read ok programming was a
success.  If not repeat steps 20, 21, and 22 until there are no errors.

23.
This step is optional.  The 'DSP A/D CONTROL' window can be used to exercise the
tool by reading the A/D values.  The options are 'OFF', 'ONCE' (Acquires the A/D
values one time and displays them), and 'CONTINOUS' (Acquires the A/D values
continuously and updates the display).  The A/D values are displayed in volts and the
hexadecimal equivalent.  If the A/D values are acquired with the inputs floating the
will results will be unpredictable, but it can indicate that the tool is functional.  To get
predictable results induce a known DC voltage less than ±5 volts at the input of all 8
channels.  Refer to the 130802-945 Circuit Description document in this manual
(DSP's A/D topic) for information on what the A/D voltage/hex value should be with a
given input.

24.
The following steps are necessary due to a bug in the DSP Diagnostic firmware.  The
bug exists in Diagnostic versions 1.0 and 1.1.  The DSP Diagnostic firmware does not
clear its program data buffer so if it cannot write or read the Flash PROM it will return
the same data back to the CPU causing the CPU to verify ok and not set any program
status errors. There is a small chance that this could happen; if it does and continued
attempts to program the PROM fails the PROM will need to be replaced. Note: The
CPU reads the programmed data back from the DSPs after the flash PROMs have been
programmed and compares the programmed data to the data it sent.

25.
Connect a clip lead across J8 on both DSP boards.

26.
On the ECLIPS select 'TOOL', 'XMACII: STATUS', then select 'ACOUSTIC RESET'
to reset the tool.

27.
On the ECLIPS system select 'TOOL', '1677 EA:DSP ACQUISITION STATUS'.

28.
Select 'ACQUIRE PROGRAM VERSION'.  Verify that all of the channels 'ACQ'
versions are the same as the file used; this indicates that the DSP's firmware (flash
PROMs) are programmed - continue to step 30.

29.
If any of the channels 'ACQ' version is the same, then the DSP firmware did not
program properly. If this happens remove the clip lead across J8 on both DSP boards.
Select 'ACOUSTIC RESET' to reset the tool.  Now go back to step 20 and reprogram
the channel(s) that did not program properly.

30.
Turn tool power off.

31.
Solder a jumper across J8 on both DSP boards.  Use a 22-gauge buss wire for the
jumper and use high temperature solder"

Continue to Section 15.16 - Firmware Checkout.





Note: During this procedure all XMACII ACTs must be 'OFF'. The two LEDs on the CPU
board (DS3 (Green) and DS2 (Red)) will be used as an aid.  Refer to Section 15.17 for additional
information regarding LED indications.

1.
Load OCT 1677diag and setup communications on the ECLIPS system.

2.
On the ECLIPS select 'TOOL', 'XMACII: STATUS'.

3.
Select 'ROM VERSION'. Verify ROM Version is 1.2 or greater.  Anything less will not program
the flash prom.

4.
Close the 'XMACII:STATUS' and turn tool power off.

5.
Copy the CPU acquisition program file, (193327x.bin) where x is the revision, to the dat1a/pass
directory. Note: make sure that the file name extension is .bin.

6.
While holding a jumper across EP1 and EP2 on the CPU board apply 180 ±5 Vrms tool power.
The two LED's on the CPU board (DS3 (Green) and DS2 (Red)) will alternate blinking for
approximately 10 seconds indicating the tool is running the 'flash loader program'.  The
jumper can be removed as soon as the blinking begins. Note: A tool reset or cycling power will
put the tool back into the acquisition program."

7.
Before continuing turn 'OFF' any ACT associated with the 1677 EA/XMACII.  This will
prevent any overwriting of the CPU program in the tool buffer.

8.
Select 'SELECT CPU PROGRAM FILE'.  This will be the program file that was copied to
dat1a/pass in step 5.  Note: make sure that the file name extension is .bin.

9.
The following is useful information.  The next step is to download the file to the CPU buffer
(Tool buffer).  The file is a fixed 64 K bytes in size.  The ECLIPS downloads the file in 2 K byte
increments using Mode 2. After each 2 K bytes are downloaded the ECLIPS automatically uploads

ECLIPS will try to download and compare one more time.  If the second time fails the ECLIPS
will abort.  If this happens try adjusting Mode 2 and Transmit settings then try downloading again.
When complete the 'WRITE TO CPU FLASH' button will be sensitized as an indication of a
successful download. If all works the first time it takes approximately 2 minutes to download all
64 K bytes.

10.
Select 'DOWNLOAD TO TOOL BUFFER'.  While the download is progressing the green led will
be 'ON' and the red led will change transitions on each 2 K-byte download.  This can help indicate
that the download is in process.  When the download is complete the 'WRITE TO CPU FLASH'
button is sensitized, the red led is 'OFF' and the green led is 'ON'.

11.
Select 'WRITE TO CPU FLASH' this will program the CPU Flash PROM's.  Do not do anything
else to the tool while programming is in process.  The green led will be 'OFF' and the red led
will be 'ON' indicating that the Flash PROM's are being programmed.  A successful programming
process takes approximately 10 seconds.

12.
When the red led goes 'OFF' and the green led goes 'ON' programming is complete.  Continue to
the next step to find out if the programming was a success.

13.
On the ECLIPS select 'TOOL', 'XMACII: STATUS', then select 'ACQUIRE STATUS' verify
'ROM CHECKSUM' is 'O.K.'.  If it is programming was a success.

14.
If there was an error the flash proms must be reprogrammed. Go back to step 11.

15.
On the ECLIPS select 'TOOL', 'XMACII: STATUS', then select 'ACOUSTIC RESET' to reset the
tool.  Resetting the tool or cycling power will put the tool into the acquisition program.

FIRING CIRCUIT / BOOST COMVERTER
Refer to Schematic drawing F184260100 during this discussion.
Dangerous voltage level are present in assemblies p/n F184260000, p/n F157018000, and p/n
F157019000. These high voltages can cause serious injury or death. Assembly p/n F184260000
has both 180 Vac, 60 Hz power and DC potentials exceeding 300 volts. Uninsulated terminals of
these assemblies have these high voltages. The cases and heat sinks of power FETs on boards p/n
F157018000 and p/n F157019000 have high-voltage DC present. Use caution when
troubleshooting and be aware of test equipment grounding.



High voltage shock
Possible death or serious injury
•
Turn off power when not required
•
Post appropriate warning signs
•
Avoid distractions while working on equipment with
power applied
•
Do not leave powered instrument unattended

The functions of this network are to:
1. Rectify and filter AC input voltage.
2. Boost the converted input voltage to about 410 Vdc. This voltage is applied to externally
mounted firing capacitor C1.
3. Provide regulation of input AC line voltage.
U1 is a quad comparator. One of the comparators is used to regulate the output voltage; this is
accomplished by sampling the voltage present at the node of resistors R6 and R7. When the voltage at
that point exceeds the reference value on U1 pin 7, that comparator switches ON and thereby alters
the control voltage at pins 5, 9, and 11; the result is to change the frequency of the oscillator portion
of U1. The frequency of the oscillator controls the placement of charge on the firing capacitor
(backbone mounted capacitor C1). The three remaining comparators are paralleled and connected as
the oscillator.
Two active circuit elements are used to produce +410 Vdc: Q1 is switched by action of U1 and draws
current through L2 (a 50 milli-Henry choke mounted on the transmitter chassis). The induced voltage
adds to that stored on the string of input capacitors (C1 through C5), and is transferred to backbone
mounted capacitor C1.

When backbone capacitor C1 is discharged (e.g., Assembly P/N F184260000 has fired a transmitting
crystal), the regulation action previously described automatically starts to recharge C1. The
approximate time to recharge is 30 milliseconds. When discharge of C1 occurs, the AC input line
voltage will drop because of the high demand of recharge current. To some extent, backbone inductor
L1 and the board mounted capacitors C1 through C5 reduces the transient affect."
1690FA-XMAC-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.0 PASSIVE TEMPERATURE SENSOR........................................................ 6,"PASSIVE TEMPERATURE SENSOR
A passive temperature sensor (RTD100) is located on the electronics chassis, inside the pressure
housing and is connected to topsub pins 9 and 10 via the top pigtail. This “passive” arrangement
is read by connecting a hand-held meter to the topsub. The sensor should read 100Ω at 0° C. The
purpose of this measurement is to provide the operator with the internal temperature so he can
determine if the temperature is low enough for the housing to be safely removed."
1690FA-XMAC-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.0 TRANSMITTER ELECTRONICS,"TRANSMITTER ELECTRONICS
Functional elements of the Transmitter electronics are illustrated in Figure 1. There are three
electronic assemblies mounted on the 1690 FA Transmitter Electronics Chassis Assembly
(Reference Drawing A3001001000). The printed circuit board assembly part numbers are: Firing
Circuit / Boost Converter Board (P/N F184260000), P-Wave Transmitter Board (P/N
F157018000) and S-Wave Transmitter Board (P/N F157019000). The terms Monopole and P-
Wave are synonymous, as are the terms Dipole and S-Wave.

P-Wave Transmitter Board
Refer to schematic drawing F157018100.
This board receives and interprets serial input commands from the 1690 EA Acoustic Main
Electronics. The board controls the switching of one of two output transformers (mounted in the
1690 BA Transmitter Mandrel), which drive the P-Wave transmitters. The serial input format for
this assembly is shown in Figure 2. Bits 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 are not interpreted.



Serial data is received with U1 (a 8-bit shift register). Serial data is latched and stored by U1, and
then made available to NAND gate U2 (2nd half of U2) (see Figure 2, Serial Communications).
Serial data is transmitted from QS of U1 to supply Serial format to the S- Wave Transmitter
Board.
The FIRE pulse is received by one-shot U3; the positive going edge of FIRE triggers the one shot
and produces a signal going from 0 V to +15 V on pin 6 of U3. The duration of the +15 V signal at
pin 6 is set by R5 and C5; the duration is approximately 50 microseconds. Pin 6 of U3 connects
with both pins 9 and 12 of U2, Input pins 8 and 13 of U2 connect with pins 14 and 7 of shift
register U1. When both inputs of one section of U2 are at +15 V, the output of that section is at
0 V. The 0 V level represents selection of a particular transmitting transducer.

Note: The circuits following output pins 10 and 11 of U2 are identical. The description of one is
equally true for the other.

The Field Effect Transistor (pair Q3 and Q4) are current amplifiers; the pair also inverts the input
voltage. Current amplification is needed to rapidly switch power FETs Q8,Q9,Q10 from the OFF
state through the linear region and then into the ON state. Rapid switching insures that FETs Q8,
Q9, and Q10 dissipate minimum power. When the serial data sets (pin 13 of U2 high and the 50
microsecond positive pulse) is applied to pin 12, the output of pin 11 of U2 will be at 0 V for 50
microseconds and the associated power FETs (Q8, Q9, and Q10) will be ON.

1690 FA HTHP XMAC Acoustic Transmitter Electronics

The primary winding of the pulse transformer (mounted in 1690 BA Transmitter Mandrel) associated
with transmitting transducer 1 connects between terminals T7 and T9. Also connected to T7, is
backbone capacitor C1, which stores the DC voltage that ""fire"" the transducers. When FETs Q8, Q9,
and Q10 are ON, the charge on backbone capacitor C1 is dumped through the primary winding and
the transducer (connected to the transformer secondary) is excited. The power FETs remain ON for
the pulse period established by U3. When pin 6 of U3 returns to 0 V, the power FETs are turned OFF
and are held OFF by the low voltage at the drain of Q4.
Power FETs are connected in parallel to handle the current discharged from backbone capacitor C1.
The discharge current has a peak value in excess of 140 Amperes.

S-Wave Transmitter Board
Refer to drawing F157019000 and schematic F157019100.
This board receives and interprets serial input commands from the 1690 EA Acoustic Main
Electronics. The board controls the switching of one of two output transformers (mounted in the

and produces a signal going from 0 V to +15 V on pin 6 of U3. The duration of the +15 V signal at
pin 6 is set by R5 and C5; the duration is approximately 210 microseconds. Pin 6 of U3 connects
with both pins 9 and 12 of U2, Input pins 8 and 13 of U2 connect with pins 14 and 7 of shift
register U1. When both inputs of one section of U2 are at +15 V, the output of that section is at
0 V. The 0 V level represents selection of a particular transmitting transducer.

Removal of the Cover and Side Plates 
1) Remove core measuring lower cover (item 15); wet joint cover (item 57); upper lock arm 
manifold covers (items 59 & 60); quad cylinder manifold covers (items 41 & 42); center 
manifold covers (items 55 & 56); transmission mount covers (items 58, 61 & 62); lower right, 
left and top covers (items 63, 64, 65 & 66) at the dual cylinder manifold; and lower lock arm 
covers (items 52, 53 & 54). 
2) Remove left side plate (item 16) by removing the eight screws (item 6 BOM A3001654000). 
 
Wire Tube Assembly Removal A3000979000 
To remove the wire tube assembly (item 8), start at lower end of the dual cylinder manifold (item 
1) perform the following: 
1) Remove the lower fitting. 
2) Rotate the lower section of the tube counter 90 degrees clockwise and pull back slowly until 
the end connector is disengaged from the manifold (item 1). Very carefully, disconnect the 
11-pin contact blocks. If replacement of the wire tube without any further disassembly is 
desired, do not pull from the wires; this would cause the harness to disengage from the 
pressure bulkhead recessed deep inside the manifold.  
3) Center tee fitting removal.

This concludes the assembly procedure for the Lower Lock Arm Housing assembly. 
 
Hydraulic Lines Installation 
1. For all lines to be formed, first measure from point to point and then add approximately  
8” to 12” (203 to 304.8mm) as required for contouring. The bends can be made with a Parker 
Hannifin tube bending tool or equivalent as follows: for 3/16"" (4.75mm) O.D. tubing use a 
Parker Hannifin #4-2829 tool that provides a 9/16"" (21.8mm) inside bend radius, and for 1/4"" 
(6.35mm) O.D. tubing use a Parker Hannifin #3-2829 tool that provides an 11/16"" (22.2mm) 
inside bend radius. 
2. Place the mandrel on a tool buggy with the drill bit facing down. Stand at the uphole  
end and rotate the mandrel clockwise 90 degrees so the drill bit is pointing to the left  
(9 o'clock). 
3. Form and install the ""Rod-Up"" which starts at the wet joint Rod Up Fitting, reference 
location A27 on DWG A3001654000 and ends at the ""Rod-Up"" port on the Center Manifold, 
reference location C21.  
4. The second “Rod-Up” line from the downhole side of the Center Manifold to the straight 
Thread Connector ([26] on DWG F181843000) on the Core Chassis.  
5. Measure a section of Tubing [99] and cut to the approximate length; again allowing for an 
additional length for bends.  
6. Rotate the Mandrel 180 degrees to run the ""Rod Down"" circuit. While plumbing the ROD 
DOWN Circuit Tee Fitting ([104] of A3001654000) will be replaced by a 4-way Cross 
Union ([33] on DWG F192830-000). Fabricate a line 1.25"" (31.75mm) long and connect one 
end to the fitting located on the uphole side of the Center Manifold.  
Connect the other end of the line to the 4-way Cross Union [33]. Run a line from the 
downhole end of the Rod Down Port on the Wet Joint [6] and a line from the Rod Down port 
at the Quad Cylinder Manifold [4] to the left two ends of the Cross Union [33].  
With the tool positioned on its side, remove the Left Side Plate [17] again. 
7. Install Fitting [24] with O-ring [40] on the Core Separator assembly as seen on DWG 
F192830000, and secure with Screw [37].  
8. Refer to DWG F192830000. The Welded Union Line [33] will overlap the Line [24] along 
the tool body in the area of the Transmission Manifold, use the Parker Union [34] as a guide, 
determine a point along the flat of the Transmission Manifold to cut both lines so that they

both engage [34] approximately 1/4"" (6.35mm) from either side. Remove the lines and rinse 
with solvent and blow clear with air. 
9. Re-install [33] and [24], and secure the two together with the Union [34] and two Nuts [43] 
and Ferrules [44]. This completes the ROD DOWN / CLOSE LOWER ARM, CORE 
SEPARATOR RESET circuit. 
Refer to DWG A3001654000 
10. With the mandrel still in the same position, the next circuit to be run is the ""Bit Retract"" 
which extends from the Wet Joint at location D27 to the Dual Cylinder Manifold at location 
D12. Note that on the removed Side Plate there is a groove to retain this tube; the groove is 
located toward the Bit side of the Mandrel.  
11. Start the tubing at the Dual Cylinder Manifold Bit Retract Port, and form an offset to enter 
the Side Plate groove. Upon exiting the Side Plate groove, offset again to the centerline of 
the Mandrel, reference location D18, 19 and D20. 
12. Follow the Mandrel body contours, then form an offset again at the Upper Lock Arm 
Manifold, reference location D26 – 27.  
13. Continue the run to the ""Bit Retract"" port at the Wet Joint location D27. Cut the tubing to 
size, de-burr, clean, install ferrules, and make up the connections. 
14. Replace the side plate and rotate the mandrel 180 degrees. Remove the side plate that is now 
facing up and repeat the same procedure described before for the ""Bit Advance"" circuit; 
starting at the ""Bit Advance"" port of the Dual Cylinder Manifold and terminating at the Wet 
Joint. Reference location D12 to D27.  
15. Rotate the mandrel so the Bit is facing down. The next circuit to run is the Metal 
Compensation circuit consisting of the two equalizer feed lines. These two lines use 1/8"" 
(3.1mm) O.D. tubing [101]. 
 
Note: The bend angles should be the minimum required to make an offset which does not 
impede the flow rate or increase the pressure differential across the drill motor. 
 
16. Start with the ""Hydraulic Motor Return"" line beginning at the center port connection of the 
Transmission assembly [7]. This line requires numerous offsets, beginning at the Center 
Manifold and then followed by the Guide Housing before running down the center line 
groove. Reference location A19 to A27.  
17. An offset is again required at the Upper Lock Arm Manifold before terminating at the Wet 
Joint. Cut the tubing to size, de-burr, clean, install ferrules, and make up the connections. 
Reference location A26 – A27 
18. Install the ""Motor Compensation"" lines following the procedure described above. The Motor 
Compensation line should be started at the outer port of the Transmission Assembly [7].

Output Shaft 
1. Slide a Bearing Spacer [18] onto the square end of the Gear Box Shaft [16] and press fit 4 
Ball Bearings [27] until they are firmly seated against the shaft shoulder. 
 
 
DO NOT APPLY FORCE TO THE OUTER RACE OF THE BEARINGS OR 
POUND THEM WITH A HAMMER. THESE ACTIONS WILL DESTROY 
THE BEARINGS. ALWAYS USE A CYLINDRICAL SLEEVE TO APPLY 
THE LOAD AGAINST THE INNER RACE AND A PRESS TO INSTALL 
THEM ON THE SHAFT. 
 
2. Install the Bevel Gear [19] onto the Shaft [16]. Press a Spiral Pin [26] to retain the gear in 
place. 
3. Slide the shaft (with bearings and gear) into the Gear Box Housing [15]. 
4. Insert the Teflon Sleeve [17] over the shaft and into the housing, with the counter bore facing 
away from the gear, and the flat side against the bearing [27]. 
5. To install the Thrust Bearing [30] and 2 Thrust Washers [31], refer to View D on the drawing 
and install the components over the Drive Shaft in the following order: 
6. Install a Thrust Washer [31], Thrust Bearing [30] and a second Thrust Washer [31]. 
7. Install 3 Shims, each .010"" (2.54mm) thick, from the Shim Kit [24] and a Cupped Spacer 
[28]. 
8. Install a Retaining Ring [34] in the housing. Position retaining ring so the sharp edges are 
away from the bearing. 
9. Install a Cupped Spacer [28] and 3 Shims [24], each .010"" (2.54mm) thick, from the shim kit. 
10. Install a Thrust Washer [31], a Thrust Bearing [30] and a second Thrust Washer [31]. 
11. Check for play in the shaft as follows: 
1. At the end opposite the gear, grab the shaft with one hand.  
2. Use your other hand to grab the housing at the other end.  
3. Push and pull to ensure there is no play either way.  
4. If play is present, add more shims in .001 or .002 inch (0.025 or 0.05mm) increments, to either 
the top or bottom cupped spacer. A general guideline for shim placement is: If there is play on 
pulling motion, add more shims to the lower cupped spacer. If there is play on pushing motion, 
add more shims to upper cupped spacer. 
5. Make sure that the gear does not touch the housing when turned. Add shims as necessary.  
 
Note: 
When the play has been eliminated, the shaft must turn freely and without binding. Due to 
the high rotational speeds, all backlash or shaft play must be minimal.

IV. 
HYDRAULIC FLUID FILLING PROCEDURE 
1. Prepare the Mandrel per  the RCOR System Checkout Setup; refer to the operating manual for 
additional information. 
2. Lock Arm Circuits:  Position the mandrel on stands with the bit opening facing up and elevate 
the Field Joint so that the Mandrel is inclined approximately 10 degrees. 
3. Open the Upper Lock Arm ports [112] on the Upper Lock Arm Manifold.  
4. Open the Lower Lock Arm supply fitting at the lower end of the mandrel, and the Union fitting 
located on the Rod Down-close arm line. Locations B2 and B4 on sheet two, respectively. 
5. Select (low pressure] and power up motors; when oil appears at the Upper Arm Manifold ports, 
turn motors off. Replace the Plugs [112] partially to allow oil flow through the threads. Do not 
seat the O-rings. 
6. Start the motor again at low pressure. Oil should begin to flow slightly through the ports at the 
Upper Lock Arm Manifold and at the Lower Arm Cylinder ports (open and close).  
 
Note: Rod Up must be ""On"" during this procedure to allow the flow of oil from the arm close circuit 
to the tank or to the open arm close fitting in the Lower Lock Arm assembly. 
 
7. Once the oil flows steadily through the slightly open ports, select Arms Close. Arms will start to 
close. Observe if air bubbles escape through either Lock Arm Cylinders ports or fittings. 
8. Cycle the tool (Arms Open - arms Close] several times until no more air is observed coming out 
of the ports. Tighten plugs and fittings. 
9. Deploy the arms again (Arm Open), with all ports closed, at Max Press.  
10. Once the motion of the arms has stop at the fully open position, toggle Rod Up off , and allow the 
auxiliary pressure to inflate the accumulator and build up to its maximum value.  
11. Let pressure stabilize at its peak for about 10 seconds, and then select Aux Pressure Low . If the 
pressure in the arm circuit does not hold, when observed with a gauge installed at the wet joint 
port, or the peak value drops to a lesser setting, air may still be present in the circuits.  
12. Repeat the bleeding procedure if necessary until all the air is evacuated from the system. 
13. Select (maximum pressure) and power up motors. When pressure peaks, select and observe 
gauge pressure. An initial drop in pressure may be seen and then it should remain steady between 
2500 and 2100 PSI. If the pressure falls off, air is present in the system, and the procedure above 
should be repeated. 
14. Push Rod Circuit: While the Wet Joint is still elevated, position the mandrel so the bit side is 
facing up.  
15. Power up the tool and lock the arms open at Max pressure, then toggle to Low Press. The Rod 
Up and Rod Down bleed plugs [100] are located, on the bit side, at the Center Manifold [3]. 
 
Note: The port closest to the downhole end, on the left side of the tool when looking down from the 
top sub with the bit facing up, is the Rod Down bleeding port. 
 
16. Loosen both plugs, then select Rod Down. Air will begin to escape through the ports. 
17. Wait for about 20 seconds and select Rod Up. Air will escape through the ports. Tighten both 
ports. 
18. With the rod at any position, open the Rod Up port partially, then actuate Rod Down.

19. Once the rod has completed its stroke down, and no more air is observed coming out of the port, 
tighten the plug then turn Rod Down off. 
20. Partially open the Rod Down port, then actuate Rod Up. Observe oil and air coming through the 
bleeding port.  
21. Once the rod has completed its stroke up, tighten the plug. 
22. Repeat these steps alternating ports until all the air has been evacuated from the system. 
23. Box to Core (BXC] and Box to Eject (BXE] Circuit: Maintain the mandrel with the bit opening 
facing up and the top sub still elevated.  
24. Start the motor and open the lock arms at maximum pressure; once the arms are open, toggle 
auxiliary pressure Low Press. 
25. The Box Core and Box Eject bleed plugs [100] are located, on the bit side, at the Upper Arm 
Manifold [10]. They are side-by-side, close to the downhole end of the manifold. 
 
Note: The port on the left side of the tool, when looking down from the top sub with the bit facing up, 
corresponds to the Box Eject circuit. 
 
26. The same procedure used previously to bleed the push rod circuits applies for this section. 
Loosen both bleeding plugs, then select Box Core. Air will escape through the ports. 
27. Wait for about 20 seconds and select Box Eject. Air will escape through the ports. 
28. Tighten both ports. 
29. With the box at the coring position, open the Box Core port partially, then actuate Box Eject.  
30. Once the box has completed its stroke and no more air is observed coming out of the port, tighten 
the plug then turn Box Eject off. 
31. Partially open the Box Eject port, then actuate Box Core. Observe oil and air coming through the 
bleeding port.  
32. Once the box has completed its stroke, tighten the plug. 
33. Repeat these steps alternating ports until all the air has been evacuated from the system. 
34. Advance and Retract Circuits: Position the mandrel with the bit opening facing up and elevate 
the down hole end of the mandrel approximately 10 degrees. The advance and retract ports [112] 
are on the Dual Cylinder Manifold. 
35. Locations B2 and B3 on sheet three. 
36. Turn on Motors. Loosen both ports, then alternately toggle on and off advance and retract to clear 
the external lines of air. Then continue to toggle on and off; some Drive Plate [29] and [30] 
motion should occur. Turn off Motors.

Note: 
The holding pressure can be confirmed by installing pressure gauges on the hydraulic section 
field joint at the Bit Advance and Bit Retract Ports. In all cases, smooth cylinder operation 
should be obtained; a jerking motion or hesitation is a sign of air in the system. The inability to 
hold low pressure on an energized circuit indicates air in the system. 
 
41. Bit Drive Motor Circuit: Position the mandrel horizontal (no elevation) with the bit opening 
facing down. For reference, the Bit Drive Motor is inside the Transmission assembly [7]. 
42. Core Measurement Box Assembly: This circuit consists of the Core Measurement Box [14], the 
Compensation Tube [50], the Feed-thru Plug [43], and the interconnecting Tubing. The oil 
circulation ports are located as follows: the in port is located on the Feed-thru Manifold on the 
left side of tool when looking down from the top sub with the bit facing up. The out port is 
located on the Core Measurement Housing [40], under the right side plate of the mandrel. 
43. The mandrel should be in a horizontal position with the bit opening at 9 o'clock as observed from 
the uphole end of the mandrel. Remove the right side plate (plate facing up), to expose the 
Circulate Out Plug on the Core Measurement Box.  
44. Remove this plug and install a modified #3 SAE fitting [116].  
45. Connect the ""from tool"" pump cart line to the modified fitting.  
46. Remove the plug [100] at the in port, install a modified #3 SAE fitting [116] and connect the ""to 
tool"" pump cart line. 
47. Elevate the field joint end of the mandrel slightly. Start the pump and begin circulating hydraulic 
fluid at 20 PSI for 15 to 20 minutes.  
48. Start the vacuum pump, close the ""to tool"" valve, and stop the circulation pump. Now let the 
vacuum pump run for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
49. Turn the vacuum pump off and start the circulation pump. Then open the ""to tool"" valve and 
open the vacuum to atmosphere; continue to circulate at 20 PSI for 20 minutes. 
50. Insert the Tee Handle [115] through Cap [52] located at B8 on sheet one, and then thread the 
handle into the Compensation Piston [51]. Pull the Piston all the way to the downhole end of its 
stroke, then push the Piston all the way to the uphole end. A surge of oil can be observed at the 
""from tool"" side of the circulation hose. Repeat this procedure to confirm no escaping air is 
visible. Now restore the Piston to the full downhole position. 
 
Note: Do not use pump pressure to move the Piston; the O-ring on the Core Measurement Box lid will 
not seal internal pressure above 20 PSI. 
 
51. Stop the circulation pump, close the valve and remove the ""from tool"" circulation line.  
52. Remove the #3 SAE fitting [116] and replace the #3 SAE plug [100]. Replace the Side Plate and 
rotate the mandrel 180 degrees clockwise. The ""to tool"" circulation hose should be facing up.  
53. Close the line valve and remove the #3 SAE modified fitting [116]. Now thread the Tee Handle 
into the Piston and then move the Compensation Piston inward until the ""MA"" mark is aligned 
with the end of Cap [52]. Oil will surge from the Connector Cover [48].

A. ADJUSTMENTS 
Refer to (FIG 1 on page 58 of F130586855) The objective of the adjustments with the Bit 
Box [1] in the coring position is to provide proper meshing of the gears, solid retention of the 
Bit Box against the Stop Screws (items 2 (see DocA3001654000 and 3). Maintain the 
perpendicularity between the bit axis and the longitudinal axis of the mandrel, and at the same 
time locating the Bit Box Guide Pin [4] at the apex of the Drive Plate [5] in the advance/retract 
slot. In the Box Eject position it is necessary that the Bit Box be properly aligned with the Core 
Receiving Box, and that the axis through the center of the Bit Box is parallel to the center line 
of the mandrel. 
 
1. Position the mandrel horizontal with the bit opening oriented at 9 o'clock as viewed from the 
field joint end.  
2. Turn on motors and if the box is not in the eject position toggle, and then remove the side plate 
that is facing up. Adjust the tilt arm link distance [9] to 3-1/2” (88.9mm) between the lower end 
of the Tilt Arm Link [6] and the lower end of the Transmission Mount [11]. Record the exact 
measurement and then replace the side plate. 
3. Rotate the mandrel 180 degrees, then remove the Side Plate and again adjust the distance 
between the lower end of the Tilt Arm Link and the lower end of the Transmission Mount to the 
same measurement as recorded from the other side.  
4. Replace the Side Plate. 
5. Toggle, Box to Core, and check the degree of meshing between the Bit Drive Gears ([4] on 
DWG. A3001369000, and [6] on DWG. A3001275000). This can be done by turning the Pinion 
Gear back and forth by hand; a slight amount of play between the gears is desirable.  
6. If there is no play or if there is too much play, then toggle and adjust the Stop Screws [2] and [3], 
accordingly. Toggle and again check the gears. Repeat as necessary to obtain the proper 
clearance. Note that while adjusting the screws, make sure the axis of the Core Box [1] is 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the mandrel. 
7. Remove the Side Plate facing up and toggle, Box to Core. Now observe the location of the Box 
Guide Pin [4] in relation to the Drive Plate advance/retract slot [12]. This Pin must be at the apex 
of the slot. To assure this, screw the Drive Plate Adjustment Rod [7] in or out; a slight resistance 
in the Adjustment Rod can be felt when the Guide Pin contacts the slots highest point. Now 
tighten the Adjustment Rod Jam Nut [8]. 
8. Replace the Side Plate, rotate the tool 180 degrees and remove the Side Plate facing up. Adjust 
this Drive Plate following the procedure above and tighten the Adjustment Rod Jam Nut [8]. 
9. With the Side Plate off, toggle, Box to Eject. The Bit Box should be aligned with Core Receiver 
Box, and the axis through the center of the Bit Box should be parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the mandrel. If not, readjust the Tilt Arm Links at a new distance [9] to correct the Bit Box 
orientation; then readjust the Drive Plates. The distance [10] between the Tilt Arm Links and the 
top of the Drive Plates should be about 11/32"" (8.7mm) to assure proper linkage operation.  
10. With both Side Plates installed, sequence between and several times to ensure all of the 
adjustment objectives have been met. 
11. Return the Box to the eject position, install 2 Clamps [35] and secure with 2 Screws [79].

VIII. PRONY BRAKE (HORSEPOWER) TEST 
Before performing the Prony Brake Test, operate the tool (moving the Gear Box, 
advancing the Drill Bit, rotating the Drill Bit and retracting the Gear Box) while 
monitoring the amperage on the 2010 Power Supply. Repeat this operation until a steady 
0.5 to 0.6 amps are constant throughout the operation.  
In order to perform the torque test, a Prony Brake Fixture (P/N 162314000) is required. 
The fixture consists of: 
• 
Prony Brake Shoe with a six inch (152.4mm) lever 
• 
Tachometer 
• 
Force Gauge 
• 
Dummy Bit 
The force gauge measures the force applied to it by a lever assembly, consisting of two 
water-cooled jaws tightened around the PowerCOR bit and lever (movement arm). The 
force gauge is held to the PowerCOR instrument by a clamping assembly, and is 
positioned so that its actuator deforms the force gauge body when acted on by the lever 
assembly.  
The jaws of the lever assembly must be cooled during operation. Cooling capabilities are 
provided by grooves in the jaws, thus allowing water to pass over the jaws near the 
PowerCOR bit. Water is supplied via a barb fitting located at the top clamp; the final 
assembly should incorporate a valve allowing adjustment of water flow.  
 
 
NEVER PERFORM THE TORQUE TEST WITHOUT USING THE 
COOLING FEATURES. 
 
The force gauge measurements (expressed in lbs.) are entered on the test form in the LBS 
column and then multiplied by 6” (152.4mm) (the distance between the force gauge 
actuator and the bit axis when the assembly is properly installed). This result in a torque 
value expressed in lbs/in and entered on the form in the TRO column. This is used with 
the RPM readings from the tachometer to derive a horsepower value from the following 
formula: 
 
Horsepower (HP) ~ = {RPM ~ Times (lb/inch)}  
 
63024 
 
The result of this equation is entered on the form in the HP Out Column. The following 
values are also recorded: 
• 
Set DV Voltage to 750 VDC.  
• 
Surface Motor V (SMV) is the voltage as indicated on the surface panel display. 
• 
Surface Motor 1 (SMI) is the total current sent down the line and is indicated on the surface 
panel display. 
• 
Select Apply. 
• 
Turn on Cooling Pump 
• 
Clamp Prony Brake to 10 lbs. 
• 
Record Bit RPM 
• 
Record current from 2010 Power Supply. (Current is used as a reference to tool efficiency.)

the Torque Level Fixture (6” (152.4mm) from the center of the Rotary Pipe). 
6. Install a small piece of reflective tape onto the Dummy Bit.  
7. Place a container with water under the Bit Box area. Using a small sump pump, attach the 
pressure hose to the Torque Level Fixture.  
 
 
AN ADEQUATE FLOW OF WATER MUST BE MAINTAINED DURING 
THE TEST TO PREVENT OVERHEATING OF THE BIT AND BRAKE 
PADS.  
 
B. TEST PROCEDURE 
1. Start the cooling water supply and then start the rotation of the Bit with zero load (Jaws not 
tightened).  
2. Position the Tachometer [4] so it can read the reflective tape on the Dummy Bit, and read the 
RPM.  
3. Record the data (RPM, Torque, Force, etc.) on the test sheet.  
4. Tighten the spring tension adjusting nuts until the Force Gauge read 1 lb (6 lb/in torque).  
5. Record the data (RPM, Torque, Force, etc.) on the test sheet.  
6. Repeat the previous step, increasing the reading on the Force Gauge by one pound each time and 
recording the data, ending at 15 lbs on the Force Gauge. 
 
Note: 
Toward the high end of the torque curve, it may be necessary to increase the flow of water, 
and to average the readings on the Force Gauge since at this point it may bounce around a 
mean value. 
Note: If stalling occurs, loosen and re-tighten the spring compression adjusting nuts to the desired 
force value. 
 
7. At the end of the test, remove Clamp Assembly Fixture, Torque Level Fixture and Dummy Bit. 
8. Reinstall the Coring Bit and rotate Bit Box back into tool.

1. 
Preparation 
Step 
Action 
1. 
Verify that equipment serial number in the ZARM matches the number on the instrument. If the 
numbers on the instrument are difficult to read, they will be remarked later.  
2. 
With thread protectors in place, thoroughly clean housing.  Preparations include washing the tool 
to remove, mud, grease, dirt and other foreign material.  
For instruments with piston type pressure compensator;  
Wash the piston area; visually inspect piston area for oil leakage. If oil leakage is found the fault 
shall be rectified before the Instrument can be placed in service.  
Air dry, Blow dry with compressed air or dry off the tool with clean rags or paper towels. Each 
step of the disassembly will include cleaning as required. 
2. 
Instrument History 
 
Step 
Action 
1. 
Verify the SAP tcode “ZARM” equipment number matches the Serial number on the tool. Record 
the amount of PM points on checklist 131113-953-CHKL. 
2. 
Use SAP tcode “ZEQFMN” to see FMNs / OTBs that have been done and need to be done. 
Ensure FMNs / OTBs are up to date; if they are not up to date you may perform the applicable 
FMNs / OTBs before this PM3 or concurrently with this PM3. 
3. 
Continuity and Resistance Tests 
Step 
Action 
1. 
It is advisable, though not required to test continuity and resistance with a 5722 X* “WEETECH” 
or digital multimeter prior to disassembly. The purpose is that this may reveal defects that can 
be investigated and repaired during the PM. Refer to Section 38 for values. 
 
 
NOTICE 
RISK OF DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT.  
Do NOT use a Megohmmeter on the strain gauge load cell 
wires or Temperature Probe wires. High Voltage will 
damage these components. Check these components using 
a Fluke Model 87 V digital multimeter or equivalent

Visual and Physical Inspection 
Step 
Action 
1. 
Visually inspect the tool for any exterior damage. Remove thread protectors and visually inspect 
the field joint threads. 
5. 
General Information 
The procedures outlined in this section are the minimum to be performed on coring tools prior to 
an operation in a well. 
Locations that have implemented a stringent cleanliness policy with regard to coring tools 
maintenance have seen a significant reduction in reported problems and tool failures. Because 
of the complexity and economies involved, not performing a coring job can actually be more 
profitable than attempting to perform one without specially trained and properly equipped 
personnel working in the correct maintenance environment. In short - If you cannot do the job 
correctly you will actually save money by not doing it at all. 

Facilities 
A dedicated clean area Coring lab must be established. The maintenance facility should be of 
sufficient size to allow a complete tool to be worked on at any one time. In a remote location a 
20 foot air conditioned tool house can be used for the purpose. 

Personnel 
Personnel performing maintenance work on coring tools must have received appropriate 
training. A dedicated coring maintenance team has proved successful in all cases. 

General Maintenance Requirements 
The valves, solenoids and restrictors, etc… in the hydraulic circuit are not forgiving of 
contamination. There are two in-line filters at the inlet and outlet of the pump that will trap and 
contain small particles or debris and prevent them from travelling through and contaminating the 
entire hydraulic system. These filters cannot remove contamination introduced during the 
maintenance operation, hence the need for a clean environment. 
 
General recommendations: 
− 
 Only use ""lint free"" cloths 
− 
Use a filter system for cleaning hydraulic oil prior to filling a module or filling the test cart. A 
20 micron filter is acceptable. 
− 
Do not carry out coring tools maintenance work in or adjacent to, any area that is not clean 
(e.g., the workshop, steam clean area, buffing area, etc…).

Effective Date: 4-Dec-2015 
1826 MA PowerCOR Preventive Maintenance Level 3 Procedure 
 
 
− 
Before using any air source to clean any electrical connector, make sure the air is dry and 
clean. Shop/lab air supplies should have water traps installed. If not, have them installed 
and properly maintain them. 
The two filters that protect the pump in the main hydraulic power supply module are sized 40 
micron and 70 micron. 
 
Particle size comparison 
A tool failure can be caused by a particle larger than 150 micron becoming lodged inside a 
check valve. 







6. 
Consumable Materials 
Consumable materials (typically Loctite, RTV, grease, etc.) are stocked on the production floor 
and used for multiple assembly jobs. They are typically listed on the BOM, but are not always 
supplied as part of the assembly kit since Production procures many of the items directly from 
an outside vendor. 
Grease used shall be free from dust, dirt, or any contamination which can cause seal failure. 
Check Lubriplate 930-AA grease Expiration date or manufacturing date. In the absence of an 
Expiration date, six years from date of manufacturing shall be used as the Expiration date.  
Grease past its Expiration date shall not be used.

Remove all atmospheric covers access to wire service. 
2. 
To remove the wire tube assembly (item 8), start at lower end of the dual cylinder manifold (item 
1) remove the lower fitting. 
3. 
Rotate the lower section of the tube counter 90 degrees clockwise and pull back slowly until the 
end connector is disengaged from the manifold (item 1). Very carefully, disconnect the 11-pin 
contact blocks. If replacement of the wire tube without any further disassembly is desired, do not 
pull from the wires; this would cause the harness to disengage from the pressure bulkhead 
recessed deep inside the manifold. 
4.

Step 
Action 
11. 
Let pressure stabilize at its peak for about 10 seconds, and then select Aux Pressure Low. If the 
pressure in the arm circuit does not hold, when observed with a gauge installed at the wet joint 
port, or the peak value drops to a lesser setting, air may still be present in the circuits. 
12. 
Repeat the bleeding procedure if necessary until all the air is evacuated from the system. 
13. 
Select (maximum pressure) and power up motors. When pressure peaks, select and observe 
gauge pressure. An initial drop in pressure may be seen and then it should remain steady 
between 2500 and 2100 PSI. If the pressure falls off, air is present in the system, and the 
procedure above should be repeated. 
14. 
Push Rod Circuit: While the Wet Joint is still elevated, position the mandrel so the bit side is 
facing up. 
15. 
Power up the tool and lock the arms open at Max pressure, and then toggle to Low Press. The 
Rod Up and Rod Down bleed plugs [100] are located, on the bit side, at the Center Manifold [3]. 
16. 
 
Note 
The port closest to the downhole end, on the left side of the 
tool when looking down from the top sub with the bit facing 
up, is the Rod Down bleeding port. 
 
Loosen both plugs, and then select Rod Down. Air will begin to escape through the ports. 
17. 
Wait for about 20 seconds and select Rod Up. Air will escape through the ports. Tighten both 
ports. 
18.

Repeat these steps alternating ports until all the air has been evacuated from the system. 
34. 
Advance and Retract Circuits: Position the mandrel with the bit opening facing up and elevate 
the down hole end of the mandrel approximately 10 degrees. The advance and retract ports [112] 
are on the Dual Cylinder Manifold. 
35. 
Locations B2 and B3 on sheet three. 
36. 
Turn on Motors. Loosen both ports, then alternately toggle on and off advance and retract to 
clear the external lines of air. Then continue to toggle on and off; some Drive Plate [29] and [30] 
motion should occur. Turn off Motors. 
37. 
With the Bit Box in the retract position, install and tighten the Upper Port Plug for the Bit Advance 
circuit, and remove the Lower Port Plug for the Bit Retract circuit. 
38. 
Turn on Motors and toggle on, Bit Advance. When the stroke is complete, toggle off and install 
and tighten the Retract Port Plug and remove the Bit Advance Port Plug. Toggle on, Bit Retract. 
39. 
When the stroke is complete, toggle off and install and tighten the Upper Port Plug. Repeat this 
procedure until no air comes from the open ports. 
40. 
When finished, retract the bit using and return the Bit Box to the eject position using. 
41. 
 
Note 
The holding pressure can be confirmed by installing 
pressure gauges on the hydraulic section field joint at the Bit 
Advance and Bit Retract Ports. In all cases, smooth cylinder 
operation should be obtained; a jerking motion or hesitation 
is a sign of air in the system. The inability to hold low 
pressure on an energized circuit indicates air in the system. 
 
Bit Drive Motor Circuit: Position the mandrel horizontal (no elevation) with the bit opening facing 
down. For reference, the Bit Drive Motor is inside the Transmission assembly [7]. 
42. 
Core Measurement Box Assembly: This circuit consists of the Core Measurement Box [14], the 
Compensation Tube [50], the Feed-thru Plug [43], and the interconnecting Tubing. The oil 
circulation ports are located as follows: the in port is located on the Feed-thru Manifold on the left 
side of tool when looking down from the top sub with the bit facing up. The out port is located on 
the Core Measurement Housing [40], under the right side plate of the mandrel. 
43. 
The mandrel should be in a horizontal position with the bit opening at 9 o'clock as observed from 
the uphole end of the mandrel. Remove the right side plate (plate facing up), to expose the 
Circulate Out Plug on the Core Measurement Box.

41. Tool Setup/Adjustment 
Refer to (FIG 1 on page 58 of 130586-955) The objective of the adjustments with the Bit Box [1] 
in the coring position is to provide proper meshing of the gears, solid retention of the Bit Box 
against the Stop Screws, items 2 and 3 (see drawing A3001654000).  Maintain the 
perpendicularity between the bit axis and the longitudinal axis of the mandrel, and at the same 
time locating the Bit Box Guide Pin [4] at the apex of the Drive Plate [5] in the advance/retract 
slot. In the Box Eject position it is necessary that the Bit Box be properly aligned with the Core 
Receiving Box, and that the axis through the center of the Bit Box is parallel to the center line of 
the mandrel. 
 
Step

in the Adjustment Rod can be felt when the Guide Pin contacts the slots highest point. Now 
tighten the Adjustment Rod Jam Nut [8]. 
8.  
Replace the Side Plate, rotate the tool 180 degrees and remove the Side Plate facing up. Adjust 
this Drive Plate following the procedure above and tighten the Adjustment Rod Jam Nut [8]. 
9. 
With the Side Plate off, toggle, Box to Eject. The Bit Box should be aligned with Core Receiver 
Box, and the axis through the center of the Bit Box should be parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the mandrel. If not, readjust the Tilt Arm Links at a new distance [9] to correct the Bit Box 
orientation; then readjust the Drive Plates. The distance [10] between the Tilt Arm Links and the 
top of the Drive Plates should be about 11/32"" (8.7mm) to assure proper linkage operation. 
10. 
With both Side Plates installed, sequence between and several times to ensure all of the 
adjustment objectives have been met. 
11. 
Return the Box to the eject position, install 2 Clamps [35] and secure with 2 Screws [79].

 CONFIDENTIAL 
P/N 130634-954 
 MAY 2013 
GENERAL INSTRUMENT SAFETY 
 
This document outlines the safety concern for this particular section of the 1970 RCI 
tool. 
 
 
 
The GENERAL OPERATION MANUAL outlines the safety procedures for Well Site 
conditions and the GENERAL MAINTENANCE MANUAL outlines procedures for 
Lab conditions common for all the RCI subs. 
 
 
 
1. 
Read safety procedures for relieving trapped pressures in the GENERAL 
MAINTENANCE MANUAL before proceeding. 
 
 
CAUTION: Always assume that every section has pressure in it until you confirm 
otherwise.  This can cause personnel injury and should be handled very 
cautiously.  As a minimum wear safety glasses, full-face shield, heavy gloves and 
clear the area of unnecessary personnel. 
 
WARNING: Leaking or faulty Lee plugs must only be replaced with the appropriate size 
Lee plug. Any other form of plugging an access port is forbidden. If rework is necessary, 
contact local AMO management to verify the location of vendors qualified to rework Lee 
plugs. If no locally qualified vendor exists, the asset must be sent to a location that has a 
qualified vendor. 
 
 
WARNING: The 1970 BB instrument is extremely heavy and operates at high hydraulic 
pressures.  Use extreme caution when handling or performing maintenance on this 
section.  
 
 
 
2. 
Use the appropriate lifting devices and techniques to move the instrument. 
 
3. 
Corrosive, noxious and/or poisonous fluids may be recovered from the well.  A 
seal failure could also expose the hydraulic oil to these dangers. 
 
4. 
Always connect “Return Line” between tool and hydraulic test cart (both ends). 
 
5. 
The 1970 BB hydraulic system operates at pressures up to 3,500 PSI.  Use caution 
when testing, disassembling and /or repairing the hydraulic system, including all 
lines and pressure connectors. 
 
6. 
The 1970 BB utilizes Lee plugs to facilitate hydraulic/sample line plumbing.  
During functional and troubleshooting operations in this section, necessary steps 
should be taken to prevent personnel injury if a Lee plug fail and become a 
projectile The following minimum steps shall be implemented. 
 
a. 
Clear the area of unnecessary personnel. 
b. 
Minimize time standing next to the tool when function testing or 
toubleshooting.

c. 
The sub should be covered to absorb the projectile. 
 
7. 
Make certain all power has been turned off while disassembling, assembling or 
otherwise performing maintenance. 
 
8. 
Oven heat treating of the assembled 1970 BB  is prohibited, as it may result in a 
damaged to the tool or property and injury to personnel due to high pressures 
generated by oil expansion within the tool.  Individual electronic chassis or CDE 
modules should only be tested outside the housing or subs; refer to the 
Repair/Maintenance section of this manual."

MAY 2012 
 
NOTE 
 
 
Sockets P/N 161641-000 and P/N 152969-000 are used in 40 pin, 25 pin and 17 pin bulkhead 
connectors, and also use the 40 pin connector block P/N 155799-000.  These sockets must be tested 
for retention force as explained below.  Any found with low retention force must be replaced as 
per FMN 04-56. If the sockets in the 40 pin connector block P/N 155799-000 have a low retention 
force, the entire block must be replaced; the block is not repairable. 
 
RETENTION FORCE TEST: 
 
Insert a new .062” dia. contact pin (such as P/N 104944-000) into the socket.  The pin should be 
firmly held (the specification for new sockets calls for 8 oz. of force required for pin removal, but some 
reduction in retention force over time is unavoidable). If the pin is very loose, the socket must be 
replaced.  
 
The linked data sheets list a step by step process for the PM3 of the 1970 BB and should be used 
in conjunction with the -855 documentation listed in the Assembly/Disassembly section of this

During the process of performing preventive maintenance, the data sheets will require a description of 
the failures. The item or items being inspected could have different types of damage or irregularities. In 
helping to describe discrepancies the terms below can be used as reference. 
Mechanical:  Radial scarring 
Usually associated with wear that occurs by something 
rotating in and out of a cavity.  
 
Longitudinal scarring 
Usually associated with wear that occurs by something 
dragging lengthwise 
 
Pitting/Crevice Corrosion 
Usually associated with corrosion of some type where pits 
start to occur on the metal or surface coating. 
 
Flow cut/Jetting 
Usually associated with an area where a high flow rate of 
fluid causes metal to erode. 
 
Dents/dings 
Usually associated with an indentation in the metal that was 
caused by being dropped, hit, or mishandled. 
 
Scratch(es) 
Similar to scarring but grooves start to appear that are 
deeper and less frequent in number. Scratches are usually 
caused by abrasion. For example sand getting into a seal 
area or a metal picks used to remove an o-ring. 
 
Scoring 
Usually an isolated groove caused by something sharp. 
Such as a burr or sharp tool (metal pick). 
 
Galling 
Usually occurs when like metals or similar hardness metals 
are mated to each other and become seized together. Most 
often occurs in threaded connections. 
 
Flaking 
Occurs when coatings start to separate from the base metal. 
 
Fretting/Peeling 
A type of wear resulting from minute reciprocal sliding 
motion which produce fine particulate contamination 
without chemical change. 
 
Fretting 
Usually produces a fine dust. Peeling appears more as 
flakes. 
 
Coining 
Due to over torque in a metal to metal sealing 
configuration. The metal stem or cone becomes distorted

When investigating seal damage or failure several factors are taken into account. The location of the 
seal, condition of the seal gland, back-up ring condition, orientation of the seal within the component, 
time between seal change and the environment in which the seal is exposed are helpful in the analysis of 
a failure. Also, simultaneous failure modes can be seen in seal analysis. 
 
Seal: Extrusion 
Occurs when the seal breaks down under pressure and is 
forced out of the seal confinement. The seal will have 
frayed or edges peeling off. 
 
Nibbling 
Associated with dynamic rod or piston seals. Appears as 
little bites taken out of o-ring.  
 
Spiral 
Deep spiral cut (usually at about 45º) into the O-ring.  
 
Abrasion 
Appears as wear lines on the cross section parallel to the 
motion of the seal. Caused be either to rough or to smooth 
metal surface, high temperatures or fluid contamination. 
 
Compression Set 
Sealing area of O-ring being squeezed is flat on both sides. 
Caused by hardening of seal due to high temperature or 
excessive squeeze needed to achieve seal.    
 
Cracking 
Usually caused by weather or ozone. Small cracks on the 
outer surface of seal. 
 
Heat Hardening 
Seal is hard and cracking or pitting. Caused by high 
temperature. 
 
Plasticizer Extraction 
Small cracks in cross-section. Caused by the service fluid 
evaporating and removing the compounds that make up the 
rubber. 
 
Installation Damage 
Cuts, punctures, or notches. Caused by mating parts, misuse 
of installation tools,  or machining details. 
 
Explosive Decompression 
Gas expansion blistering, ruptures or splits deep in the O-
ring. Caused by gas absorbed under high pressure unable to 
escape. 
 
Back-up Ring 
The seal shows similarities of nibbling or extrusion, except 
failure is in area of scarf cut. Caused by temperature and 
pressure changes, or extrusion of back-up ring.

Description of Service 
 
1970 DB Straddle Packer Section 
P/N 130896-935 
MAY 2006 
The 1970 DB Straddle Packer section is the proposed solution to broaden the range of operation of 
the RCI service to low permeability, fractured, vuggy and highly laminated formations. This 
translates directly in an increase in market participation and associated revenues generated by the 
service. 
 
The current RCI tool w/conventional probe only addresses the market segment of pressure testing 
and sampling in homogenous formations with relative permeabilities from 1 mDarcy/cp to 1 
Darcy/cp.  Running in fractured, vuggy, shaly, laminated, tight and in some highly invaded soft 
formations is very difficult or impossible due to the inability of the standard packers to create a 
seal to isolate the formation or because the area of the probe is too small to produce any 
reasonable fluid flow. 
 
The Straddle Packer section will also have additional applications: 
! When combined with a standard probe, interference testing can be performed to estimate 
vertical permeability. 
! Interference testing by Injecting / Fall-Off testing as an alternative to pumping out to 
wellbore. 
! Formation strength determination (i.e. Mini-Frac testing) 
! Cased hole Pressure Testing  and Sampling 
 
NOTE: 2. and 3. could require taking an injection fluid such as water in a large sample tank 
from surface. 
 
Tool Description: 
The 1970 DB RCI Straddle Packer consists of two inflatable packers that are set in the borehole 
wall isolating the section of the formation to be tested. The fluid inlet port is placed above the 
center of the isolated section to optimize the sample clean-up process. 
 
A filtration element placed around the entry port prevents the ingression of debris and mud solids 
into the sample line thus reducing the chances of plugging. 
 
Interference testing is achieved by placing a single probe (MB) on top of this section. In order to 
reduce the distance between the isolated zone and the single probe (MB), the electronics module 
(LCDE) and control valves will be placed at the bottom of the tool, contrary to any existing RCI 
section. The sample line Quartz pressure gauge it is located between the inflatable packers, at the 
same level of the fluid inlet thus eliminating the effects caused by fluid columns above or below 
the gauge in the pressure measurement. 
 
To facilitate transportation, handling and installation and removal of the packer elements the 
mandrel is designed in sections: top sub, upper and lower mandrels and bottom sub. 
 
! The top sub consists of the upper RCI standard field joint. This sub is removable to allow 
the installation of the top packer element. 
! The upper mandrel holds the quartz pressure gauge and the fluid temperature probe, and 
their associated electronics. The top packer element is mounted onto this mandrel. 
! The lower inflatable packer element is mounted over the lower mandrel. This mandrel 
will be available in the future in various lengths for 3 ft. or longer sealing intervals. 
! The bottom sub houses all the valves, solenoids, sensors and electronics needed to control

! The packer elements are attached to the mandrels from the top with a threaded collar for 
easy replacement. The bottom of the packer elements slide freely during inflation and 
deflation as consequence of the packer grow in the radial direction. The packers will 
automatically deflate in case of a tool power loss. 
 
Most of the parts utilized are standard RCI components proven very reliable in existing designs: 
Quartzdyne QHB-16 K or 25 K quartz pressure gauge, dirty fluid valves (Gilmore’s), hydraulic 
solenoids valves, packer inflation pressure gauges (ISI). Moving the LCDE (Long Common 
Distributed Electronics) to the bottom of the section required a new assembly with connectors 
reversed, so this component it is not longer compatible with other versions of the LCDE.

• 
Packer inflation pressure max: 2500 PSI (A pressure sensor is used to monitor the 
inflation pressure and a relief valve limits the maximum inflation pressure to prevent 
destruction of the elements). 
• 
Safety features: 
• 
Burping slots on the mandrels to limit the maximum packer opening and prevent their 
destruction when opened beyond their design ranges. 
• 
The Packer inflation pressure is immediately released when electric power is interrupted. 
The outer elastomers layer will return the packer to its original shape after the internal 
pressure is released. This operation can take up to 20 minutes.  
• 
Maintenance of the tool as per existing RCI guidelines. The packer elements must be 
replaced after every job. Multiple runs in one job are not recommended but under certain 
environmental condition and after a complete evaluation of risks and benefits is done 
multiple runs may be allowed. Please consult Engineering. 
 
 
Health and Safety requirements:  Special handling equipment will be required during rigging 
operations due to its size and weight. 
 
Transportability: 
The tool could be broken up in sections for easy transportation, and then made up in the catwalk. 
Fluid filling with a vacuum/circulating cart not required after re-assembly."

1970 DB STRADDLE PACKER 
HYDRAULIC CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION 
  
P/N 130896-945 
MAY 2006 
 
 
The instrument consists of four sections: Top Sub, Upper Mandrel, Lower Mandrel and 
Downhole Valve Sub. 
 
 
Figure 1 - Hydraulic Diagram 
 
The Downhole Valve Sub section consists of three Dual Pilot (DP) valves and one Normally 
Open (NO) valve controlled by seven (7) solenoids. The inflation pressure of the elements is 
measured by a differential strain gage (DPG1) also contained in this sub. This pressure is 
measured relative to the hydraulic return line (~ hydrostatic). 
 
Formation pressure is measured by a Quartzdyne (APG1) pressure gauge and the sample line 
temperature by a dedicated RTD (RTD2) located in the Upper Mandrel at the fluid inlet of the 
tool.  
 
The Emergency deflate mechanism consists of a NO valve activated by applying electric power 
to SV9 and hydraulic pressure to maintain the valve shut. In the event of a tool malfunction the 
valve will immediately open thus deflating the elements. Once this valve is opened, to close it 
again it is necessary to re-apply motor voltage to activate SV9, and then full buss pressure to

Figure 2 shows the location of the emergency exit port in the downhole sub. This port is also 
used to purge the elements prior to RIH. 
 
Solenoids SV7 and SV3 are used to control (DP3) the Elements Inflation Valve (EIV). This 
valve connects the elements with the sample line allowing the pumping of fluid to inflate them. 
The Emergency Deflate (NO) and the Sample Isolation (DP1) valves must be closed to inflate 
the packers. 
 
During inflation and deflation the Equalizing Valve (DP2) must remain open to communicate the 
isolated zone to the balance line (L2) thus preventing pressure build-up between the packers. 
 
The line marked L2 (balance) in the tool diagram represents the balance line. This is a passage 
that communicates the borehole above and below the isolated zone between the packers. The 
main purpose of this line is to maintain the borehole above and below the isolated zone at 
constant hydrostatic pressure during operation of the tool. Otherwise a differential across the 
packers could strain the upper mandrel and packers or cause the tool to move. 
 
Figures 3 show the location of the ends of this passage in the top and downhole subs.

Solenoids SV4 and SV8 are used to control DP1 the Sample Isolation Valve (SIV). This valve 
communicates the formation inlet port with the sample line allowing when it is open to pump 
from/to the isolated portion of the formation. In the closed position it isolates the formation and 
the pressure and temperature sensors to make the post-production volume as small as possible. 
This valve must also remain closed while performing pretests with the MB probe. 
 
A Dirty Fluid Pressure Relief Valve (DFPRV) is provided to limit the elements inflation pressure 
to ~2300 PSI."

GENERAL INSTRUMENT SAFETY 
 
This document outlines the safety concern for this particular section of the 1970 RCI 
tool. 
 
 
 
The GENERAL OPERATION MANUAL outlines the safety procedures for Well Site 
conditions and the GENERAL MAINTENANCE MANUAL outlines procedures for 
Lab conditions common for all the RCI subs. 
 
 
 
WARNING: Leaking or faulty Lee plugs must only be replaced with the appropriate size 
Lee plug. Any other form of plugging an access port is forbidden. If rework is necessary, 
contact local AMO management to verify the location of vendors qualified to rework Lee 
plugs. If no locally qualified vendor exists, the asset must be sent to a location that has a 
qualified vendor. 
 
 
1. 
Read safety procedures for relieving trapped pressures in the RCI GENERAL 
MAINTENANCE MANUAL before proceeding. 
 
 
 
2. 
Instrument weight is very high (over 500lbs/226kgs for the mandrel itself). Use 
the appropriate lifting devices and techniques to move the instrument.  This 
instrument consists of four sections, and when assembled is heavier and longer 
than current RCI modules.  Use the appropriate lifting devices and techniques to 
move the instrument. Suggested techniques would be a three point lift of the 
mandrel to minimize bending. 
 
 
 
3. 
DO NOT inflate the packer elements inside a casing inadequate to the size of 
packer being inflated. Select the appropriate casing size to prevent over expansion 
and possible damage or catastrophic failure of the element. 
 
4. 
Keep hands and fingers clear of the packer elements while inflating and deflating 
them. 
 
CAUTION 
 
Always assume that every section has pressure in it until you confirm otherwise.  
This can cause personnel injury and should be handled very cautiously.  Always 
wear safety glasses, or a full-face shield, heavy gloves and clear the area of 
unnecessary personnel. 
WARNING: 
The 1970 DB Instrument is extremely heavy, has moving external parts and operates 
at high hydraulic pressures.  All handling and maintenance must be performed while

Always connect “Return Line” between tool and hydraulic test cart (both ends) to 
avoid blowing off the Solenoid Valve Cover located in the downhole section. 
 
9. 
Oven heat testing of the assembled 1970 DB is prohibited, as it may result in a 
damaged to the tool or property and injury to personnel due to high pressures 
generated by oil expansion within the tool.  Individual electronic chassis or CDE 
modules should only be tested outside the housing or subs; refer to the 
Repair/Maintenance section of this manual. 
 
10. 
After tripping out of the hole, if the packer elements have swelled from original 
size, this may be a sign of trapped internal pressure.  Take caution while deflating 
the elements. 
 
RELIEVING PRESSURE IN RCI SUB IN LAB 
 
The following procedure shall be followed for relieving trapped internal pressure for all 
RCI subs mentioned above.  
 
 
If Hydrogen Sulfide is present, special precautions must be taken when disassembling the

3. Thoroughly flush both packer elements with fresh water inside and out to remove any residual drilling 
fluids. Material used in construction of packer elements are easily corroded when left in contact with 
drilling fluids even for short periods. 
4. Thoroughly flush sample and equalizing lines with fresh water before breaking sections apart to prevent 
contamination of electrical connectors with drilling fluids. 
5. Remove and replace all static seals in the field and tool break out joints. 
6. Remove and replace all dynamic and static seals in the packer assemblies. 
7. Replace elements with new ones. Reusing of the elements it is not recommended as the rubber outer 
cover, internal sleeve and the metal ribs can deteriorate with use and exposure to borehole fluids. 
8. Perform continuity and leakage tests as indicated in PM3. 
9. Remove, clean and refill the buffer tube. 
10. Remove, clean, inspect and redress all Gilmore valves.

During the process of performing preventive maintenance, the data sheets will require a description 
of the failures. The item or items being inspected could have different types of damage or irregularities. 
In helping to describe discrepancies the terms below can be used as reference. 
 
Mechanical: Radial scarring  
Usually associated with wear that occurs by something rotating 
in and out of a cavity.  
 
Longitudinal scarring

When investigating seal damage or failure several factors are taken into account. The location of the 
seal, condition of the seal gland, back-up ring condition, orientation of the seal within the component, 
time between seal change and the environment in which the seal is exposed are helpful in the analysis of 
a failure. Also, simultaneous failure modes can be seen in seal analysis. 
 
Seal: Extrusion 
Occurs when the seal breaks down under pressure and is forced out 
of the seal confinement. The seal will have frayed or edges peeling 
off. 
 
Nibbling 
Associated with dynamic rod or piston seals. Appears as little bites 
taken out of o-ring.  
 
Spiral 
Deep spiral cut (usually at about 451) into the O-ring.  
 
Abrasion 
Appears as wear lines on the cross section parallel to the motion of 
the seal. Caused be either to rough or to smooth metal surface, high 
temperatures or fluid contamination. 
 
Compression Set 
Sealing area of O-ring being squeezed is flat on both sides. Caused 
by hardening of seal due to high temperature or excessive squeeze 
needed to achieve seal.    
 
Cracking 
Usually caused by weather or ozone. Small cracks on the outer 
surface of seal. 
 
Heat Hardening 
Seal is hard and cracking or pitting. Caused by high temperature. 
 
Plasticizer Extraction 
Small cracks in cross-section. Caused by the service fluid 
evaporating and removing the compounds that make up the rubber. 
 
Installation Damage 
Cuts, punctures, or notches. Caused by mating parts, misuse of 
installation tools, or machining details. 
 
Explosive Decompression Gas expansion blistering, ruptures or splits deep in the O-ring. 
Caused by gas absorbed under high pressure unable to escape. 
 
Back-up Ring 
The seal shows similarities of nibbling or extrusion, except failure is 
in area of scarf cut. Caused by temperature and pressure changes, or 
extrusion of back-up ring.

1970EB-RCI-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"The Main electronic cartridge for the Reservoir Characterization Instrument (RCI) is a
modular chassis assembly designed for ruggedness, ease of service, and space utilization.
All wiring is attached to low maintenance motherboards. This allows the circuit boards to
be easily removed without flexing or removing any wires.
The electronics cartridge is comprised of:
• Glue board interface
• Power supply and motherboards
• Main Electronics board"
1970EB-RCI-AMO,"CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 2.0 GLUE BOARD INTERFACE, P/N 180314-000","The glue board interface is named for its function of “gluing” all of the other main
electronics functional blocks together. Wires coming from the up-hole and down-hole
ends of the electronic cartridge are terminated on the glue board. Power for the entire tool
comes from the switch mode power supply. Power is distributed to the RCI bus thru the
glue board. The main processor is attached to the glue board at connector P1. Power for
the main processor board is routed to P1. Voltage monitors from the power supply, are
routed through the glue board and distributed to P1 for processing by the main processor
board.
Although not presently being used, WTS through wires can be switched on and off with
relays RLY3 through RLY6. Control signals come from the main processor through driver
transistors Q1 and Q2 to operate the WTS relays (RLY3 through RLY6). Motor thru wire
control comes from the main processor board through drive transistors Q1 and Q3 and
operates the relays K1 thru K3 in the hydraulic power section.
A Howland constant current source U32 is used to drive the motor RTD in the hydraulic
power section. Five-volt reference U31 supplies a constant voltage. Amplifier U32
maintains 2.5 ma through the RTD. The voltage across the RTD is acquired on the main
processor board. A second current source (U30) exists but is not used at this time.
RLY1 is used to switch between drives for the hydraulic power pressure sensor. Resistors
R60 or R61 terminate the drive not being used. Control signals for RLY1 originate from
the main processor board and are used by transistor Q2 to drive RLY1
The power for the 30-volt solenoid bus can come from two sources: the 480vac motor
supply or the 180vac-tool supply. The 480vac motor source, has the capability to drive the
solenoids and is used during normal operations. The 180vac-tool power supply is used
during tool initialization, emergency operation, or troubleshooting. The relay that switches

between the two sources is RLY7. Relay RLY7 is normally closed and powers up in the
480vac motor power position. Control signals from the main processors can switch RLY7
through drive transistor Q4. In normal operation, the unregulated solenoid DC power from
the 480vac motor supply drives the 30-volt linear regulator on the switch mode power
supply and is connected to the RCI bus 30 volt DC power. In switched operation, power to
the 30 volt linear regulator is supplied by the unregulated 30 volt DC, generated from
the180vac tool power in the hydraulic power section. Diodes D2 and D3 block the current
from going back into the 30 volt regulator U80, located on the switched mode supply."
1970EB-RCI-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 3.0 POWER SUPPLY MOTHER BOARDS,"The power supply input card (155803-000) is the wire connection point for the unregulated,
rectified 30-volt tool power and unregulated, rectified 30 volt motor voltage, coming from
the hydraulic power section.
Note: These unregulated DC voltages will measure approximately 38vdc.
The power supply output card (155867-000) is the wire connection point for the ± 5 volts,
± 15 volts, + 30volt regulated solenoid power, and power supply voltage/current monitors."
1970EB-RCI-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 4.0 POWER SUPPLY ASSEMBLY P/N 164133-000,"The power supply is a combination switch mode and linear supply.
The +30-volt solenoid output has a linear regulator U80. The approximately 38vdc
unregulated solenoid voltage comes from the hydraulic power section and IC U80 regulates
the output voltage to +30 volts at a maximum of two amps. The maximum operating input
voltage to the regulator (U80) is 40 volts DC. Care must be taken not to exceed 480 vac
motor voltage, which in turns supplies the unregulated solenoid DC. Resistor R99 is for
current sensing. When amplified by U27, this signal yields 1 V/amp.
The +5 volt output is a switch mode output.
U5 is a 12-volt linear regulator supplying operational power to the control circuitry of the
power supply. U1 is a pulse width modular (PWM) which monitors and maintains the +5
volts on the output while limiting excessive current.
Note: +5 volt is used for a reference, when measured directly on the power supply, the
voltage must be between 5.32 to 5.44vdc at the output.
U7, is a 2.5 volt reference, that supplies a constant reference voltage used to regulate the
output voltage. The output voltage is divided across R9, R10 and the difference between
the reference voltage and the output voltage determines the width of the pulse output to
maintain the correct output voltage.  U3 supplies a reference voltage of 10 volts that is

divided across R1 and R2 that provides a primary cycle current limit reference to the I-
SENSE pin of the PWM. Current sense transformer TR2 monitors the current flowing in
the primary of the output transformer TR1. The voltage coming from the TR2 secondary is
rectified and connected to the +CUR_SEN pin of the PWM. This will limit the current of
each cycle to the current determined by the voltage on the I-LIMIT pin.
OUT_A and OUT_B are exclusive square wave 100khz pulses to drive the high-speed
power FET’s Q1 and Q2. Sinking current through the primary of TR1 induces currents in
the secondary. The second currents are full wave rectified by D1 and filtered by L1, C5,
and C8. The output passes through current sensing resistor R16. When amplified by U4,
this signal yields 1 V/amp.
The ±15 volt output is also a switch mode output. Its control circuit is very similar to the +5
volt control circuit.
U15 is a 2.5 volt reference, that supplies a constant reference voltage used to regulate the
output voltage. U11 is a pulse width modular (PWM) which monitors and maintains the
+15 volts on the output while limiting excessive current. U3 supplies a reference voltage of
10 volts that is divided by R51 and R 52 to provide a primary cycle current limit reference
to the I-SENSE pin of the PWM. Current sensing is done with TR52, rectified by D53, and
returned to the PWM. The primary of output transformer TR51, induces currents in the
secondary. The positive pulses are rectified by D51 and filtered by L51, C61, and C62 to
provide the +15 volt output. The negative pulses are rectified by D52 and filtered by L52
and C64, to provide the –15 volt output.
The +15 current passes through sensing resistor R69. When amplified by U19, this signal
yields 1v/amp.
The –5 volt output comes from linear regulator U57 with its input coming from the –15
volt output.
The voltage and current sensing outputs are multiplexed using two, 8-channel multiplexers
U8 and U9. Control and acquisition of the sensing signals are routed through the glue board
and processed by the main processor board."

• Central Processing Unit and Memory
• WTS Communications
• RCI Bus Communications
• 16-Channel, 12-Bit Acquisition System
• Four-Channel Analog Output System and Solenoid Drivers

CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT & MEMORY
The central processing unit is built around the Harris RTX 2000 microprocessor, U1. This
processor has a separate 16-bit wide memory address and data bus, as well as a 16-bit
peripheral data bus. This allows DMA transfers from memory at the same time data is
being handled on the peripheral bus.
Two 32k X 8 EPROM’s U21 and U22, from the 16-bit wide program storage memory.
Two 32k X 8 static RAM,s, U23 and U24. Form the 16-bit wide temporary storage
memory.
Reset for the processor comes from the configuration completion of FPGA (field
programmable gate array), U3. The DONE_PG pin will stay low until the part is
completely configured. This signal goes to the TMR_DPIN of U2 where it is inverted and
becomes the high active reset for processor U1. The WAIT pin is used to halt the processor
clock during DMA (direct memory access) operations.
The 16 Mhz system clock, comes from oscillator U51 and is divided by the FPGA U2. The
8 MHZ clock from U2 pin 76 is tied to ICLK (U1 pin B1) to run the processor. The 4 MHZ
processor clock is available at PCLK (U2 pin 59) to use for peripherals.
Memory address bus MA1-MA14 is used to access the RAM and EPROM memory.
Memory address bus MA15-Ma19 goes to FPGA U2 and is used to address multiple
memory pages and generate chip selects. Memory data lines MD0-MD15 carry bi-
directional data to the memory. General data bus GD0-GD15 is used to control the
peripheral operations across the board. GI0, GR/W, and GA0-GA2 are control lines used
when the processor talks to its peripherals through the general data bus. LDS, UDS, and
MR/W- are control lines used when accessing memory. The BOOT and INTA signals are
not used. The nets connected to E11 through E15 are external interrupts that will be
discussed later.
U2 is an FPGA configured to operate as memory interface, Manchester encoder and
decoder interface, and RCI bus RS232 interface. DATA_IN, CCLK, and DONE_PG are
the data, clock and control signals for the FPGA configuration from U6. The memory
interface uses MA15-MA19, UDS, LDS, and MR/W to generate RAM_CS, EPRM_CS,
EEPM_CS (CS is chip select), RAMWE_LO, RAMWE_HI (WE is write enable),
RAMOE_LO, RAMOE_HI, EEPE_HI, EPROE_LO, and EPROE_HI (OE is output).

These signals are used to read and write to RAM, EPROM, and history storage EPROM.
MAN_ESC, MAN_SNDT, MAN_SDO, AND MAN_EE are all Manchester encoder
signals. When the write shift register has shifted its last bit, a WTS-WRIT interrupt is
generated on processor interrupt two, to indicate the next word can be loaded for writing.
MAN_C/D-, MAN_VW, MAN_ID, MAN_TD, MAN_DSC, and MAN_SDI are all
Manchester decoder signals. When a full Manchester word is received into the read shift
register, a WTS_READ interrupt is generated on processor interrupt one, to indicate the
word needs to be read. 232_XLNX is an output RS232 data stream sent to the driver
(through jumper XMT_J3) on the RCI bus. When the last bit has been transmitted, a
232_DONE interrupt is generated on processor interrupt five, to indicate the next data byte
can be loaded for transmission.
RCVR_IN is an input RS232 data stream coming from receive on the RCI bus. When the
last bit has been received, a 232_INPT interrupt (through jumper RCV_J3) is generated on
processor interrupt four, to indicate a byte has been received and needs to be read. The
PWRDWN signal is used if the main processor board is to be shut down in case of failure.
Control circuits U19 and U20 are used to provide the required programming voltages to
EPROM U25. During normal operating conditions, VPP_CTL signal high, Q2 conducts
and both VPP and VCC_EPR voltages are at 5 volts. To enable programming, VPP must be
raised to 12.75 volts and
VCC_EPR must be raised to 6.25 volts. When control signal VPP_CTL goes low, five
volts is applied to the positive (+) input of the OpAmp. The voltage divider on the emitter
of the transistor provides the proper gain to yield the proper output voltages.
U8 is an FPGA configured to operate as a multi-port interface. Bits, grouped in registers,
can be set or reset to control various peripheral devices. The GD bus is the data channel
between the interface and the processor. The GA0-Ga2 bus and ASIC_PG0-ASIC_PG3 bus
are used to address the different registers. The PBUS is a 12-bit bi-directional bus used to
read and write parallel data to other devices. DATA_IN, CCLK, and DONE_PG are the
data, clock, and control signals for the FPGA configuration from U9."
1970EB-RCI-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 5.2 WTS COMMUNICATIONS,"The WTS interface is the same as other WTS tools. CMD signals from the instrument bus
pass through receive transformer T1, are reshaped by receiver U13, and are decoded by
Manchester chip U12. Mode 2 signals come from the Manchester chip and amplified by
driver U14, passing through transmit transformer T2 to the instrument bus. All control
signals and data for the Manchester chip come from U2 as described earlier.

1970EB-RCI-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 5.3 RCI BUS COMMUNICATIONS,"The RCI bus communications is differential RS232 at 38.4k baud. The serial data stream
comes from the UART in U2 and goes to differential driver U10. The outputs from the
driver U10 becomes the HST_TX_HBL (Host Transmit High Base Line) and HST)
TX_LBL (Low Base Line) signals on the RCI bus. Driver output is enabled all of the time.
The HST_RX_HBL and HST_RX_LBL (Host Receive High and Low) signals come from
the RCI bus, and are capacitivly coupled to biasing network R5 through R9, processed by
receiver U11. The biasing network holds the receiver inputs at a differential of 400 to 600
mv allowing the received signals to be detected. The output of the receiver goes to the
UART in U2.

16-CHANNEL, 12-BIT ACQUISITION SYSTEM
Analog signals from the main electronics and hydraulic power sections are multiplexed by
U28. Control signals for addressing and enabling come from the Xilinx U8 interface chip.
U50 is a temperature chip that monitors main electronic temperature. The output of the
multiplexer U28 is connected with the output of the multiplexers from the switch mode
power supply (U8 and U9) thru the glue board, to the main processor card. The output is
buffered by amplifier U30 before going to U31, a 12-bit unipolar successive approximation
A to D converter. The control signals and data bits are processed by the Xilinx U8 interface
chip. The –5 volt reference voltage is supplied by U35. The 500k clock signal comes from
the clock divider in FPGA U2 pin85.
An active low pass filter U102 is used between the 2k RTD mounted on the motor in the
hydraulic power section and the analog mux U28. The hydraulic pressure transducer signal
is amplified by U37, then low-passed filtered by U101 before going to the analog mux
U28.
5.5   FOUR-CHANNEL, EIGHT-BIT ANALOG OUTPUT SYSTEM & SOLENOID DRIVERS
U32 is a quad 8-bit D to A ( D/A ) converter. The D/A output voltage is determined by
values written into the registers from the PBUS. Signals DAC_WR, DAC_A0, and
DAC_A1 are controlled from the Xilinx interface U8. Input reference voltage is supplied
by U34. Outputs A and C are used to control the amount of current supplied to the bypass
solenoid (output A) and dump (output C) solenoid respectively.
The Digital to Analog converter U32 output A is the input to U100. As the current
increases, the output of amplifier U100, feeding the gate of FET Q3, decreases until it
reaches a steady state. The voltage feedback from the current sensing resistor (R4) will then

track the input voltage from the D/A. RLY2 and its drive transistor are used to disable FET
Q3 in the case of a failure.
NOTE: At this time, the current limiting software is not available or supported. The
current is either zero or 100%.
Output B works in the same fashion using components Q4, RLY1, and U110. At present,
the B circuitry is not used.
The drive circuit using Q5, U17, RLY3, U111, and D/A output C works in the same
manner except for one additional function. The digital detect circuit is a means by which
the physical movement of the solenoid plunger can be detected. Current builds in the
solenoid coil after being energized and once the force of the spring is overcome, the
plunger moves into the coil. This change in inductive reactance creates a current fluctuation
in the solenoid current. This fluctuation is filtered and amplified by U18 and fed into a high
speed input pin IN3 of Xlinix interface U8. A timer is started when the solenoid is
energized and is stopped when the digital detect pulse indicates the plunger has moved.
NOTE: The digital detect is not currently supported."

The GENERAL OPERATIONS MANUAL outlines the safety procedures for
Well Site conditions and the GENERAL MAINTENANCE MANUAL outlines
procedures for Lab conditions common for all the RCI subs.

CAUTION: Always assume that every section has pressure in it until you confirm
otherwise. This can cause personal injury and should be handled very cautiously. as
a minimum wear safety glasses, full-face shield, heavy gloves and clear the area of
unnecessary personnel.

WARNING: Leaking or faulty Lee plugs must only be replaced with the
appropriate size Lee plug. Any other form of plugging an access port is forbidden.
If rework is necessary, contact local AMO management to verify the location of
vendors qualified to rework Lee plugs. If no locally qualified vendor exists, the
asset must be sent to a location that has a qualified vendor.

1.Read safety procedures for relieving trapped pressures in the General
Maintenance Manual before proceeding.

WARNING: The 1970 GB instrument operates at high hydraulic pressures. all
handling and maintenance must be performed while exercising extreme caution.

2.Use the appropriate lifting devices and techniques to move the instrument.

3.Corrosive, noxious and/or poisonous fluids may be recovered from the well. A
seal failure could also expose the hydraulic oil to these dangers.

4.Always connect “Return Line” between tool and hydraulic test cart (both ends) to
avoid over pressuring the return line.

5.The 1970 GB hydraulic system operates at pressures up to 3,750 PSI. Use caution
when testing, disassembling and/or repairing the hydraulic system, including all

WARNING: High pressure can cause personal injury and should be handled very
cautiously. As a minimum, wear safety glasses, full-face shield and heavy gloves when
performing this procedure. Clear the area of unnecessary personnel, set up a barrier
isolating the sub and add a barrier between the technician and the pressurized sub.

If Hydrogen Sulfide is present, special precautions must be taken when disassembling the
tank assemblies, cleaning sample tanks and disposing of residue. Contact your local HS&E
representative and refer to the HS&E Operational Control documents “Hydrogen Sulfide”
and “Respiratory Protection”, available on the HS&E intranet site.

RELIEVING PRESSURE IN RCI SUBS IN THE LAB

CAUTION: Always assume that every section has pressure in it until you confirm
otherwise.

WARNING: While examining sections for trapped pressure, keep yourself and others out
of the line of potential blast from a sudden release of pressure. As a minimum, wear safety
glasses, full-face shield and heavy gloves when performing this procedure.

1. Secure the sub on a tool cart.

2. Referring to the assembly drawing, locate the test ports at the uphole end of the sub.

3. DO NOT assume that all pressure has been relieved if the thread protector is still secure.
The hydraulic quick disconnects could “check the pressure within the field joint cavity.

4. Check to see if pressure exists by using a spanner wrench against the bail and begin
unscrewing SLOWLY. If large resistance is felt, then pressure MUST be present.

5. Pick the RETURN line test port; locate an appropriate ball end hex wrench for the SAE
fitting. Rotate the sub such that the test port is not facing the technician.

6. Tie a 12 inch(30cm) length of strong cord to the handle of the ball end hex driver, then
tie the cord to your wrist. This restricts the travel of the hex driver if it is blown out of your
hand and may prevent it from hitting your face.

CAUTION: If a SAE fitting is difficult to remove, DO NOT PROCEED ANY
FURTHER; red-tag the section, then place in a safe area and leave for 24 hours. The
section may bleed down by itself in this time. Be sure that the section is placed well away
from all personnel. Check the section again for trapped pressure as outlined. If the SAE
fitting is still difficult to remove, let the section set for another 24 hours. Check the section
again for trapped pressure as outlined. If the SAE fitting is still difficult to remove, contact
Operations Engineering for further instructions.

7. Using the ball end hex driver wrench, unscrew in ¼ turn increments the SAE fitting
SLOWLY until the pressure begins to bleed. Continue to bleed until no resistance is felt
on the SAE fitting and the technician does not hear any pressure bleeding whistling
noise.

8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for the PRESSURE line test port.

9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for the SAMPLE line test port.

10. Repeat Steps 3 through 9. Continue to bleed until no resistance is felt on the thread
protector and the technician does not hear any pressure bleeding whistling noise.

11. Cautiously remove the thread protector completely.

During the process of performing preventive maintenance, the data sheets will require a description 
of the failures. The item or items being inspected could have different types of damage or irregularities. 
In helping to describe discrepancies the terms below can be used as reference. 
 
Mechanical: Radial scarring  
Usually associated with wear that occurs by something rotating 
in and out of a cavity.  
 
Longitudinal scarring 
Usually associated with wear that occurs by something 
dragging lengthwise 
 
Pitting/Crevice Corrosion  Usually associated with corrosion of some type where pits start 
to occur on the metal or surface coating. 
 
Flow cut/Jetting 
Usually associated with an area where a high flow rate of fluid 
causes metal to erode. 
 
Dents/dings 
Usually associated with an indentation in the metal that was 
caused by being dropped, hit, or mishandled. 
 
Scratch(es) 
Similar to scarring but grooves start to appear that are deeper 
and less frequent in number. Scratches are usually caused by 
abrasion. For example sand getting into a seal area or a metal 
picks used to remove an o-ring. 
 
Scoring 
Usually an isolated groove caused by something sharp, such as 
a burr or sharp tool (metal pick). 
 
Galling 
Usually occurs when like metals or similar hardness metals are 
mated to each other and become seized together. Most often 
occurs in threaded connections. 
 
Flaking 
Occurs when coatings start to separate from the base metal. 
 
Fretting/Peeling 
A type of wear resulting from minute reciprocal sliding motion 
which produces fine particulate contamination without 
chemical change. 
 
Fretting  
Usually produces a fine dust. Peeling appears more as flakes. 
 
Coining 
Due to over torque in a metal to metal sealing configuration.

When investigating seal damage or failure several factors are taken into account. The location of the 
seal, condition of the seal gland, back-up ring condition, orientation of the seal within the component, 
time between seal change and the environment in which the seal is exposed are helpful in the analysis of 
a failure. Also, simultaneous failure modes can be seen in seal analysis. 
 
Seal: Extrusion 
Occurs when the seal breaks down under pressure and is forced out 
of the seal confinement. The seal will have frayed or edges peeling 
off. 
 
Nibbling 
Associated with dynamic rod or piston seals. Appears as little bites 
taken out of o-ring.  
 
Spiral 
Deep spiral cut (usually at about 451) into the O-ring.  
 
Abrasion 
Appears as wear lines on the cross section parallel to the motion of 
the seal. Caused be either to rough or to smooth metal surface, high 
temperatures or fluid contamination. 
 
Compression Set 
Sealing area of O-ring being squeezed is flat on both sides. Caused 
by hardening of seal due to high temperature or excessive squeeze 
needed to achieve seal.    
 
Cracking 
Usually caused by weather or ozone. Small cracks on the outer 
surface of seal. 
 
Heat Hardening 
Seal is hard and cracking or pitting. Caused by high temperature. 
 
Plasticizer Extraction 
Small cracks in cross-section. Caused by the service fluid 
evaporating and removing the compounds that make up the rubber. 
 
Installation Damage 
Cuts, punctures, or notches. Caused by mating parts, misuse of 
installation tools, or machining details. 
 
Explosive Decompression Gas expansion blistering, ruptures or splits deep in the O-ring. 
Caused by gas absorbed under high pressure unable to escape. 
 
Back-up Ring 
The seal shows similarities of nibbling or extrusion, except failure is 
in area of scarf cut. Caused by temperature and pressure changes, or 
extrusion of back-up ring.

1970 IB SAMPLEVIEW


P/N 130949-935
FEBRUARY 2005

SampleViewSM IA (previously known as the NIR or Fluid Characterization Module) is a module that is
run in conjunction with our wireline formation tester, the Reservoir Characterization Instrument (RCI).
Its primary purpose is to monitor, in real time, the formation fluid that is being pumped from the wall of
the well by RCI, especially in those wells drilled with oil based mud (OBM).  When the optical properties
of the fluid stop changing, the sample has reached its minimum OBM contamination and we can divert
the sample that is being pumped into a sample collection tank.  To get good accuracy from subsequent
PVT analyses of the collected sample, it is essential that the collected samples be as clean as possible.

SampleViewSM IA consists of a visible and near infrared fluid analyzer with 17 optical channels. These
channels are closely spaced over the highly absorbing asphaltene region of the spectrum, which is the
region most often used to monitor contamination levels. Therefore, in most cases, there will be at least
one channel, which can span the entire transition from nearly pure filtrate to nearly pure formation fluid.
When the response of these channels levels off over time, the sample is at minimum oil based mud filtrate
contamination.

The vertical axis on the spectral plot below is Optical Density (OD), which is a logarithmic scale.  One
OD = 10 db is a 101 or 10-fold reduction in light intensity at that color.  Two OD = 20 db is a 102 or 100-
fold reduction in light intensity, and so on.  Spectroscopists use OD, which is also called Absorbance,
because the concentration of an absorbing species is proportional to its absorbance for a fixed pathlength.

SampleViewSM provides real time near infrared spectra of the fluid that the RCI is pumping from the
formation.  By monitoring its response, we can ensure that samples are at a minimum contamination
level. The graph on the left shows a spectrum of the Gulf of Mexico crude.  The graph on the right
shows a representative sample clean up over time as the SampleViewSM response of a channel levels

1970 IB SAMPLEVIEW


P/N 130949-935
FEBRUARY 2005


BENEFITS / ADVANTAGES

SampleView IA helps us to determine in real time when we have reached minimum oil based mud
contamination so that we can avoid wasting expensive rig time with unnecessary pumping but still
provide our clients with the cleanest samples possible.  SampleView IB provides additional means for
monitoring fluid cleanup such as monitoring the fluid refractive index or fluid fluorescence over time.
Both of these new techniques are interface techniques so they have low sensitivity to the passage of sand
or other particulates. Although these tools were designed to monitor sample cleanup in wells drilled with
OBM, we found that they can also be used to monitor cleanup in wells drilled with WBM.


In addition to monitoring sample cleanup, SampleView IB provides a measure of the methane content
of a fluid sample.  Also, for a given fluid type, the IB’s refractive index measurement can be correlated
to the fluid’s density. Similarly, the IB provides the color distribution of a crude oil’s UV fluorescence,
which can be correlated to its API gravity. The brighter and more blue the UV fluorescence, the higher
the API gravity, provided that there are aromatics in the oil.  Only aromatics fluoresce.  Therefore, natural
gas and synthetic base oils (which have been designed to be aromatic-free) do not fluoresce."

1970IB-SVW-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION - 2.0 POWER SUPPLY,"POWER SUPPLY

There are two independent power supplies in the SAMPLEVIEW tool. The main power
supply provides all of the operating voltages for the acquisition electronics and is
operational whenever tool power is applied. The lamp power supply provides power for
the bulbs and the filter wheel stepper motor.

The main supply consists of power transformer T1, rectifiers BR1 & BR2, filter chokes
L1 and L2, and the main regulator board. Output voltages available are +5 D, +5 A, and
-5 A and are easily measured at the terminal post buss.

The lamp supply consists of power transformer T2, filter choke L3, and a capacitor filter
board that also contains the rectifier diodes. The important point to note is that the 180vac
feeding the primary side of T2 is switched through the lamp power relay card. When
instrument power is applied the relays are de-energized and lamp power will be zero.
Upon initializing lamp power with the proper software command the CPU will energize
the relays on the lamp relay card and subsequently provide lamp power."

Introduction

The receiver card is designed to individually acquire and process 8 analog
channels. Each channel contains a differential amplifier front end, a D/A
Converter for offset control and eight 24 bit sigma-delta A/D converters with an
input range of -3 to +3 V.
The present SAMPLEVIEW tool uses 3 receiver cards totaling 24 analog
channels.

Circuit Description

Each card has its own power on reset IC to reset the D/A and A/D converters. A
10 MHz oscillator is used to provide a clock for the A/D, FPGA, and D/A. A
single Actel chip provides a Synchronous Serial Interface to the CPU card as
well as all state machine timing and control for each of the A /Ds. A common
Sync line is provided by the CPU to each of the receiver cards and subsequently
to each of the A/Ds. It is important that all of the internal clocks on the 24 A/Ds
are synchronized so that transmission of data to the CPU does not “time out”.

Each of the 3 receiver cards is identical and can be readily swapped with each
other. Address selection jumpers are installed on each of the chassis connectors
and are read by the card during power up. Digital inputs to each card are buffered
by a 74 HC04 hex Schmidt trigger. Outputs are driven by an octal 74 HC244 line
driver. Communication to the CPU is through a synchronous serial protocol
consisting of a common clock and individual Tx and Rx data lines.

Eight sigma-delta A/Ds are used to synchronously acquire the input signals.
Each A/D converter has 2 channels. Channel 1 is connected to the output of its
corresponding differential amp and represents the Voltage produced by the photo
diode. Channel 2 is connected directly to the output of its corresponding D/A,
and is used in test mode.

Eight D/A converters are provided and are configured to inject a DC offset
voltage into its respective input amplifier. This injected voltage is used in two
ways. First in “test mode” this voltage is sampled by channel 2 of its
corresponding A/D and is used to trouble shoot or verify A/D operation.
Second, in “log mode” this voltage “bucks out” any negative offset present
at each photo diode, especially, at higher temperatures.

Introduction

The lamp driver card has the capability to selectively drive three lamps with up to
1.5 Amps @ 8 V and two UV LEDs.  The present SAMPLEVIEW tool has two
lamps but only one lamp is illuminated at a time. The third lamp driver circuit
drives a Resistor load and is used to dynamically maintain a constant current load
regardless of weather the bulb or the LED is on or off. This “load balancing” is
necessary to maintain a constant cablehead voltage under the changing load
conditions of the SAMPLEVIEW. When the bulb and the UV LED is off, the
resistor load shunts the current that previously went to the bulb. When a lamp is
fully ON, the resistor load will be supplied minimum current. Similar load
balancing is executed with UV LED is ON.

An interlocking protection circuit is incorporated in the UV LED drive circuit to
protect the user from UV radiation. Hall Effect device assembly 198190-000
sense the presence of the top, A3000215-000 and bottom A3000216-000 covers
and enable the lamp driver circuit to power the UV LEDs. The drive circuit will
also be disabled if there is break in the wiring to the Hall Device assembly from
the lamp driver card.

Circuit Description

Address selection jumpers are installed on the chassis connector and are read by
the card during power up. Digital inputs to the lamp driver card are buffered by
a 74 HC04 hex Schmidt trigger. Outputs are driven by an octal 74 HC244 line
driver. Communication to the CPU is through a synchronous serial protocol
consisting of a common clock and individual Tx and Rx data lines.

A single Actel chip provides a Synchronous Serial Interface to the CPU card as
well as all state machine timing and control to each of the A /Ds. A common
Sync line is provided by the CPU to the lamp interface card and subsequently
to each of the A/Ds. It is important that all of the internal clocks on the 4 A/Ds
are synchronized so that transmission of data to the CPU does not “time out”.

The analog section has three D/A converters that set the current to each lamp.
Each of the A/D converters measures the voltage and current on its respective
lamp. Channel 1 of each A/D measures voltage and channel 2 measures current.
One additional A/D is provided and configured to measure the temperature.
Temperature from a probe embedded into the preamp box is sampled on channel
1. Channel 2 converts the temperature from a probe mounted directly on the PC
card.

Introduction

The preamp board is designed to convert the photocurrent produced by each of
the light sensitive diodes to a voltage. There are 12 identical preamplifier circuits
on each of the 2 preamp boards (preamp A & B). Each circuit however, has its
own unique gain. The gain is selected by the value of feedback resistor chosen.
The value of the feedback resistor for each preamplifier depends upon the type of
diode, light input with respect to wavelength and responsivity of the diode at its
operating wavelength.

Each diode is wired using a shielded twisted pair wire with a molded connector.
The anode and cathode of the diode are connected between the two wires of the
twisted pair with the shield left open at the diode end. The shield at the connector
end is connected to AGND (±5 V Return). The Preamplifier box is isolated from
the main instrument chassis, then connected to AGND by an external wire.
This keeps all the diode bodies at GND potential.

Circuit Description:


All 12 preamplifiers are identical so only one preamplifier channel will be
described. Consider channel 10. The diode is connected between two amplifiers,
sections A & B of U1 in such a way that there is zero voltage across the diode.
The light on the photo diode will generate a current that is converted to a voltage
by each amplifier (photocurrent * Feedback resistor). The output of each
amplifier is connected to a Differential Instrument Amplifier. The output of the
first amplifier will be positive while the other one will be negative. The output
of both amplifiers is summed at the differential amp. The output will be negative
because of the polarity of the diode connections.

Each of the input opamps will have a slight input offset voltage. The difference
between the voltages will be seen across the diode and will generate a small
current. Due to the high resistance (1500 G OHMS) of the diode at room
temperature this current will be negligible. This current will increase as
temperature increases due to change in resistance of the diode and input offset
voltage of the amplifiers. The difference in the bias currents of the two amplifiers
will increase as temperature increases. But, since they are fed into opposite
polarities of the differential amplifier they will cancel. The currents are produced
even when the bulb is off."

CPU

The 1970 IB operate as a command-response system, where the responses to a command
are defined in the WTS Firmware Specifications document (P/N 194898-000). The WTS
Manchester encoder-decoder protocol for M2/M5/M7 communications is used.  Mode 5
or Mode 7 is selectable by the WTS ‘map to mode’ command.  The ECLIPS acquisition
system automatically sends the ‘map to mode’ WTS command when the OCT is
initialized or when TOOL Re-Init is selected.

NOTE: mode 7 is installed on the SAMPLEVIEW CPU card but is not used.

WTS command signals and DC power are connected to the CPU board by connector P1.
All other cards are connected to P2.

The CPU board has these functions:
1. Power up / down reset signal for the CPU.
2. Clock, 24 MHz oscillator.
3. Interface to CPU, Mode 2, Mode 5 and Mode 7 (not used).
4. Memory, data memory of 256 Kbyte’s RAM and program memory of 256 Kbyte’s
sector erase flash memory.
5. One ACTEL field programmable gate array is used for the ""glue logic"" functions.

POWER UP / DOWN RESET LOGIC
POWER UP RESET
The RESETIN\ signal from U7-6 will be inactive until the +5 V signal is above
4.4 V.

POWER DOWN RESET
The RESETIN\ signal from U7-6 will become active when the +5 V signal
< 4.4 V.
CLOCK
U6 is a 24 MHz oscillator and provides a clock signal to U8-10 and U5-22 (CLKIN).
The CPU internally uses a divide-by-2 clock function to produce a 12 MHz CPU
clock.  The CPU uses this clock signal to generate internal timers.
MEMORY
U9 (Low byte) and U10 (High byte) together form a program memory consisting of
256 K bytes of Sector Erase Flash Memory, and U11 (low byte) and U12 (high byte)
together is a data memory of 256 K bytes of RAM.  The EPROM is addressed at
F0000 to FFFFF and the RAM is addressed at 00000 to 3 FFFF.   UCS selects
EPROM addresses and LCS selects RAM addresses."

CLOCK GENERATION

U5 divides the 24 MHz clock signal (CLKIN) by 2 when JMP2 is installed on CLKSEL
(U5-91).
U5 then divides the 12 MHz clock signal by 3, 12, 24, 48, 64, 120, and 12000 to provide:

1. a 500 KHz clock for Mode 2 transmitter logic (U5 internal).
2. a 250 KHz clock signal for the Mode 2 receiver logic (U5 internal).

WTS INTERFACE (MODE 2, MODE 5)

Mode 2 Receive Command / Data: Mode 2 commands / data are sent from the surface
and transformer-coupled via T2 on the CPU board.  U2 converts line signals to TTL
levels. The equivalent of a 6408 Harris Manchester Encoder / Decoder has been
incorporated into Actel (U5).  U5 decodes this Manchester protocol data (MD2 UDI) and
converts the serial data to parallel data. U5 checks the received data for a universal
address 00 or tool address 5 D. If either address is received, interrupt M2 RXIRQ (INT1)
is sent to the CPU (U8) and the command is transferred to a buffer. M2 RXIRQ is reset by
the CPU after the command is read by the CPU. If data follows the WTS command,
interrupt M2 RXIRQ (INT1) is sent to the CPU (U8) and the data is transferred to a
buffer. M2 RXIRQ is reset by the CPU after each data word is read.

Mode 2 Transmit Data: On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit data via
Mode 2 (Such as tool tables or tool status) the CPU enables interrupt INT2 (M2 TXIRQ)
and sends the requested data via the 16 bit data bus to U5, Mode 2 encoder logic.  U5
converts the data from parallel to serial format and the U5 6408 Harris Manchester
equivalent encoder, encodes MD2 BZO data and MD2 BOO data. Data is then sent to line
driver (U1).  Data is then transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T1.  Whenever the U5
data buffer is empty, U5 generates an interrupt (M2 TXIRQ); and the CPU sends the next
word.

Mode 5 DMA Control: The equivalent of a 6409 Harris Manchester has been
incorporated into Actel (U5) for Mode 5 data transmission. Mode 5 data is transmitted
using DMA channel 0 (DRQ0).  SMD57 DRQ (See Figure 945-5) selects which mode
will provide the DMA request.  When SMD57 DRQ is set to ‘0’ Mode 5 uses DMA
channel 0 controlled by MD57 DRQ.

Mode 5 Transmit Data: On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit Mode 5
data the CPU enables DMA channel 0 and writes the requested data via the 16 bit data
bus to U5, Mode 5 encoder logic.  The data is converted from parallel to serial format by
U5.  Serial data is received by the U5 6409 Harris Manchester equivalent encoder and the
encoded data (BZO5 and BOO5) is sent to line driver U3.  Mode 5 data is then
transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T3.  Whenever the data buffer is empty,
MD57 DRQ is active; and the CPU writes the next data word via the 16 bit data bus to
U5.
Transmission of data is currently used only when sending Subset E."

SYNCHRONOUS SERIAL TRANSMIT/RECEIVE LOGIC

The clock speed is set by firmware and currently 1 MHz is used throughout. Each of these
serial links has a transmit-frame sink (bgateout/TFS_x) for beginning and ending a
transmission, and a data transmit (bdataout/DT_x) line for transmission of data  (i.e.
tables, commands, etc.).  Each of these serial links also has a receive-frame sink
(bgatein/RFS_x) and a data receive (bdatain/DR_x) line for receiving data.


The CPU writes commands and data to U5’s two 8 bit latch’s via the data bus. Data is
converted to the serial format using the 1 MHz SCLK and two 8 bit shift registers.
Bgateout\ is active low, and bdataout  is the serial data signal.  Data is shifted out on the
positive edge of BSCLK while BDATAOUT is low.  STXDRQ (DRQ3) becomes active
whenever the output latch is empty."

The serial data of is shifted into two 8-bit serial-in, parallel-out shift registers on the
positive edge of BSCLK when BGATIN frame signal is active (high).  The Actel (U5)
inverts the data before it is shifted into the shift registers. A 16 bit counter and flip flop
are used to latch the data into two 8-bit latches.  The flip flop is also used to indicate to
the CPU that data has been received (S1 RXDRQ).  The flip flop is reset when the CPU
reads the data.  The S1 RXDRQ signal is connected to the CPU DRQ1 signal.

SAFETY PRACTICES


The SAMPLEVIEW section weighs over 250 pounds. When lifting the tool, always get adequate
assistance from your co-workers. Use a hoist when appropriate. Use safe lifting techniques to avoid
back strain and injury to fingers.


If the tool is flooded, avoid releasing pressure accidentally and protect eyes from spray or steam jets.
If internal pressure must be vented, remove the retaining ring and slowly back off the relief plug. The
exhaust will exit the tool through a small hole in top sub.


If the UV light package is present in the detector assembly, do not look directly at the light.
See Section 5.0.


When the tool is connected to high voltage supply, take suitable care to avoid shock. Only qualified
technicians and engineers are allowed to work on the tool when powered.


If running the SAMPLEVIEW in lab in conjunction with the rest of the RCI string, refer to the specific
procedures and OTB=s related to RCI safety."
1970IB-SVW-AMO,LAB SAFETY - 5.0 UV EYE SAFETY,"UV EYE SAFETY


The 1970 IB SampleView uses ultraviolet LEDs of peak wavelength, 395 nm.  Intensity drops to 50%
of peak by 374 nm and 414 nm.  For reference, the color violet is roughly 400 - 425 nm.


Each TO-18 package contains 9 UV LEDs, each of which has an intensity of 2.5 mW, so each TO-18
generates 22.5 mW of light.  The 1970 IB SampleView has two TO-18 cans containing a total of 18
UV LEDs generating 45 mW of UV light.  With the 1970 IB housing removed, two long cover plates
can be seen on the chassis.  Some UV light may leak around these long cover plates even though they
remain in place, which is why UV safety glasses or a UV-opaque chassis cover are required when
the housing is removed and power is applied to the tool. By design, if these cover plates are
removed from the chassis, no electrical power will go to the UV lights."

WARNING:
Do NOT look at these LEDs when they are turned on!





They can damage eyes even with brief exposure!


Although they are BRIGHT, you cannot tell that they are bright because your eyes can only barely
see their light, if at all (bright UV LEDs are used because crude oil fluorescence is weak).




If the 1970 IB SampleView is powered with its housing removed:



UV Safety Glasses should be worn or cover the chassis with a UV-blocking material



Post UV Warning Signs for Any People Passing By.


UV Safety Glasses (PN A2001852000) must be available at each base that is running SampleView
IB.   These glasses provide 6 powers of ten (a million-fold) reduction in UV light intensity.


UV Warning Signs (PN A1000689000) must be posted in areas where the tool might be run with its
housing removed to warn passers by.


An opaque cardboard tube (PN A2001854000) can be slipped over the UV light section of the
chassis to cover it.  Alternatively, Kapton film, which is yellow and absorbs UV light, can be draped
over the tool when the housing is off to protect people who are nearby.


A UV lab safety kit which contains these three items plus a UV light meter (PN A3000526000) has
been created, but as of the date of release of this manual this kit (PN A5000118000) had not been
released in SAP.  Order the above items separately."
1970IB-SVW-AMO,LAB SAFETY - 6.0 USE OF UV LIGHT METER (PN A3000526000),"USE OF UV LIGHT METER (PN A3000526000)


The UV light meter can be used to check for UV light leakage around the protective cover plates. In
the experience of Engineering, such leakage is very minor (typically around 1 Lux).  Although this
meter is originally sold to measure visible light, we convert it to a UV meter by gluing a UV filter
over its photodetector.

Flip the meter’s main switch to the “Lux” position to turn it on.  More detailed manufacturer's
Operating Instructions are included with the meter.  For easier use, the sensor head can be detached
from the body of the meter.  Because standards regarding allowable 8-hour levels of UV exposure
are given in microwatts/cm2, each light meter is individually calibrated in Houston and a label is
attached to the meter, which gives its equation for converting from Lux to microwatts/cm2.  The
calibration equation varies from meter to meter.  A typical equation would be like the one below.

Microwatts / cm2  = 7.57 * Lux  – 21.19.


A UV light leakage check should be performed when the tool first arrives to verify the integrity of
the cover plates.  The check only needs to be performed occasionally (such as at each PM3)
thereafter.  It is performed with housing is removed and the tool powered up.  Check all around the
perimeter of the cover plates in a darkened room; hold the sensor head about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away
from the shield, with the detector facing the shield.  Readings should be below 25 Lux.  If they are

above this level, the cover isn’t fitting well because typical readings should be only 1 Lux."

Make sure that the cover plates have the correct part number for SampleView 1970 IB and that they
are properly installed.  If the leakage problem persists, contact Engineering for further instructions.


The American Conference of Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is an association of health and safety
professionals dedicated to industrial hygiene, environmental, and occupational health and safety.
They are widely recognized for their Threshold Limit Values publications which list the TLV's®* for
over 700 chemical substances and physical agents.

The ACGIH publication ""Ultraviolet Radiation: TLV® Physical Agents 7th Edition, 2001"" lists 2882
microwatts/cm2 as the maximum allowable combined skin and eye exposure to 395-nm light over an
8-hour period.  Although 395 mm is our peak output wavelength, much of the output of the UV LEDs
in SampleView IB occurs at shorter wavelengths (deeper into the UV) than this peak.  At 375 nm,
these UV LEDs still produce about half of their peak light intensity.  Because shorter-wavelength
UV light is more damaging than longer-wavelength UV light, less exposure is allowed.  The allowable
8-hour combined skin and eye exposure level to 375 nm light is 1354 microwatts/cm2.

For a given number of microwatts/cm2, the corresponding Lux reading will vary from meter to meter.
It can be calculated from the conversion equation label that is placed on each meter.  As an
easy-to-remember guideline, which requires no calculations, we can use the Lux reading of the least
sensitive meter that we calibrated (the one that gave the lowest Lux readings for a given number of
microwatts/cm2).  For that meter, we found that 2882 microwatts/cm2 corresponded to 305 Lux and
that 1354 microwatts/cm2 corresponded to 145 Lux.

Therefore, as a worst case scenario guideline involving making measurements with a lower
sensitivity meter and assuming that all of the light is at the more-damaging shorter wavelength of 370
nm, a very cautious maximum Lux reading for allowable 8-hour exposure is:







145 Lux

We believe that this is a cautious guideline because if we take the UV meter outdoors in bright
sunlight, we usually get readings in excess of 1500 Lux, which is more than ten times greater than
145 Lux.

Overview 
Introduction 
The In-Situ Fluid Explorer (IFX) is a near-infrared analyzer module, continuous refractometer 
and fluorescence analyzer module for complete downhole fluid characterization. It also measures 
downhole fluid density and fluid viscosity using a (small) piezoelectric tuning fork sensor.  
The in-situ fluid explorer (IFX) is a module that is run in conjunction with the RCI/RCX wireline 
formation tester. Its primary purpose is to monitor, in real time, the formation fluid that the 
RCI/RCX is pumping from the wall of the well, especially in those wells drilled with oil-based 
mud (OBM). Optimal use of all the sensors in the IFX would ensure the collection of low-
contamination samples, which are needed to get good accuracy from subsequent PVT analysis of 
the collected samples. 
Theory of Operation 
The tool has three primary sensors: the optical fluid analyzer, the tuning fork and the acoustic 
transducer. The last two sensors are located in the SampleView Sample Tube (SST). Below is a 
brief description of the theory of operation of these three sensors. 
Optical Fluid Analyzer 
This consists of: 
• 
A visible and near-infrared fluid analyzer with 19 optical channels. These channels are 
closely spaced over the highly absorbing asphaltene region of the spectrum — the region 
most often used to monitor contamination levels.  
• 
Refractometer. The IFX tool provides a Continuous Refractometer to measure the 
fraction of light, R, reflected at the Sapphire-Fluid interface. The measured value of R 
will determine the refractive index, n. The value of n can help to distinguish between gas, 
water and oil. It provides an effective tool to monitor sample contamination and clean-up. 
Figure 1 uses the equation R = (1– nF/nS)2 / (1+nF/nS)2 to plot the percentage of light 
reflected from a sapphire-fluid interface versus the fluid’s refractive index (nF). Note that 
the minimum reflection (0%) occurs when the fluid’s refractive index exactly equals the 
sapphire window’s refractive index (nS = 1.746). 
• 
Fluorescence Spectrometer. Fluorescence is the emission of longer wavelengths of light 
when a sample is illuminated by shorter wavelengths of light. A 400 nm light (which is at 
the borderline between ultraviolet and visible) is used and the emitted fluorescence is 
measured at the visible colors — blue, green, yellow, red and deep red. All crude oil 
fluoresces, but synthetic oil does not fluoresce. Therefore, fluorescence is an alternative

The vertical axis on the spectral plot shown in Figure 3 is Optical Density (OD), which is a 
logarithmic scale. One OD = 10 db is a 101 or 10-fold reduction in light intensity at that 
color. Two OD = 20 db is a 102 or 100-fold reduction in light intensity, and so on. 
Spectroscopists use OD, which is also called absorbance, because the concentration of an

Tuning Fork 
The tuning fork sensor, located in the SampleView Sample Tube (SST) is immersed in the 
downhole fluid. The resonant frequency of the tuning fork is a function of the fluid density; it 
decreases with denser fluid density. Fluid viscosity is a complex function of the real and 
imaginary impedance of the fork and the resonant frequency. The ratio of the applied voltage 
to the in-phase and out-of-phase current through the sensor gives the impedance of the sensor 
in the fluid.  
Thus the real impedance would be the ratio of the applied voltage to the in-phase current, 
while the imaginary impedance would be ratio of the applied voltage to the out-of-phase 
current.  The impedance of the sensor is determined for a range of frequencies.  
Below is a plot of the admittance (reciprocal of impedance) versus frequency. In the figure 
below, the real admittance curves are plotted with solid lines, while the imaginary curves are 
plotted with dashed lines. From right to left, the admittance curves are tuning fork admittance 
measured in air, oil and water respectively. The resonance peak corresponds to the amplitude 
or peak of the real admittance curve. This peak moves further to the left with increasing fluid 
density. The imaginary admittance curve appears to the left of the real admittance curve. 
Increasing fluid viscosity dampens the motion of the fork and reduces the amplitude of the 
resonance peak, increasing the width between the real and imaginary admittance curves. Plots

Acoustic Transducer 
The IFX also measures speed of sound through the downhole fluid in the SampleView 
Sample Tube (SST). The acoustic transducer is located on a flat spot on the SST. The 
downhole fluid flows between two parallel surfaces machined inside the SST. The transducer 
is acoustically coupled to the SST and is excited to produce an acoustic pulse.  
The same transducer is also used to receive the echoes of the acoustic pulse. The response is 
digitized at 40 MHz (25 ns) and the responses are plotted as channels with respect to time. 
The very first peaks (channels 0–50) corresponding to the excitation pulse might not be 
displayed, depending on the setup.  
Next are the reverberations of this acoustic pulse within the SST wall, with each 
reverberation amplitude declining with time. The first group of reverberations is the reflection 
inside the SST close to the transducer. The second group of reverberations is from the far wall 
of the SST. Sound speed can be calculated by dividing the round-trip distance by the round-
trip time. Water has higher sound speed (shorter round-trip travel time) than does oil. As 
pressure increases, the sound speed increases, so the round-trip travel time gets shorter (see

procedures and OTB=s related to RCI safety."
1970IC-IFX-AMO,Lab Safety - 5.0 UV EYE SAFETY,"UV EYE SAFETY

The 1970 IC IFX uses ultraviolet LEDs of peak wavelength, 395 nm.  Intensity drops to 50% of
peak by 374 nm and 414 nm.  For reference, the color violet is roughly 400 - 425 nm.

Each TO-18 package contains 9 UV LEDs, each of which has an intensity of 2.5 mW, so each
TO-18 generates 22.5 mW of light.  The 1970 IC IFX has two TO-18 cans containing a total of 18
UV LEDs generating 45 mW of UV light.  With the 1970 IC housing removed, two long cover
plates can be seen on the chassis.  Some UV light may leak around these long cover plates even
though they remain in place, which is why UV safety glasses or a UV-opaque chassis cover are
required when the housing is removed and power is applied to the tool. By design, if these cover
plates are removed from the chassis, no electrical power will go to the UV lights.







Ultraviolet LEDs are used in the operation of this tool
UV LEDs can damage eyes even with brief exposure
•
Do NOT look at the LEDs when they are
turned on.

Although they are BRIGHT, you cannot tell that they are bright because your eyes can only
barely see their light, if at all (bright UV LEDs are used because crude oil fluorescence is weak).

UV Safety Glasses (PN A2001852000) must be available at each base that is running IFX IC.
These glasses provide 6 powers of ten (a million-fold) reduction in UV light intensity.

UV Warning Signs (PN A1000689000) must be posted in areas where the tool might be run with
its housing removed to warn passers by.

An opaque cardboard tube (PN A2001854000) can be slipped over the UV light section of the
chassis to cover it.  Alternatively, Kapton film, which is yellow and absorbs UV light, can be
draped over the tool when the housing is off to protect people who are nearby.

A UV lab safety kit which contains these three items plus a UV light meter (PN A3000526000)

NOVEMBER 2011

The UV light meter can be used to check for UV light leakage around the protective cover plates.
In the experience of Engineering, such leakage is very minor (typically around 1 Lux).  Although
this meter is originally sold to measure visible light, we convert it to a UV meter by gluing a UV
filter over its photodetector.
Flip the meter’s main switch to the “Lux” position to turn it on.  More detailed manufacturer's
Operating Instructions are included with the meter.  For easier use, the sensor head can be
detached from the body of the meter.  Because standards regarding allowable 8-hour levels of UV
exposure are given in microwatts/cm2, each light meter is individually calibrated in Houston and a
label is attached to the meter, which gives its equation for converting from Lux to
microwatts/cm2.  The calibration equation varies from meter to meter.  A typical equation would
be like the one below.

Microwatts / cm2  = 7.57 * Lux  – 21.19.


A UV light leakage check should be performed when the tool first arrives to verify the integrity
of the cover plates.  The check only needs to be performed occasionally (such as at each PM3)
thereafter.  It is performed with housing is removed and the tool powered up.  Check all around
the perimeter of the cover plates in a darkened room; hold the sensor head about 1 inch (2.5 cm)
away from the shield, with the detector facing the shield.  Readings should be below 25 Lux.  If
they are above this level, the cover isn’t fitting well because typical readings should be only 1
Lux.

Make sure that the cover plates have the correct part number for IFX 1970 IC and that they are
properly installed.  If the leakage problem persists, contact Engineering for further instructions.

The American Conference of Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is an association of health and
safety professionals dedicated to industrial hygiene, environmental, and occupational health and
safety.  They are widely recognized for their Threshold Limit Values publications which list the
TLV's®1

The ACGIH publication ""Ultraviolet Radiation: TLV® Physical Agents 7th Edition, 2001"" lists
2882 microwatts/cm2 as the maximum allowable combined skin and eye exposure to 395-nm
light over an 8-hour period.  Although 395 mm is our peak output wavelength, much of the output
of the UV LEDs in IFX IC occurs at shorter wavelengths (deeper into the UV) than this peak.  At
375 nm, these UV LEDs still produce about half of their peak light intensity.  Because shorter-
wavelength UV light is more damaging than longer-wavelength UV light, less exposure is
allowed.  The allowable 8-hour combined skin and eye exposure level to 375 nm light is 1354
microwatts/cm2.
for over 700 chemical substances and physical agents.

For a given number of microwatts/cm2, the corresponding Lux reading will vary from meter to
meter.  It can be calculated from the conversion equation label that is placed on each meter.  As
an easy-to-remember guideline, which requires no calculations, we can use the Lux reading of the
least sensitive meter that we calibrated (the one that gave the lowest Lux readings for a given
number of microwatts/cm2).  For that meter, we found that 2882 microwatts/cm2 corresponded to
305 Lux and that 1354 microwatts/cm2 corresponded to 145 Lux.

Therefore, as a worst case scenario guideline involving making measurements with a lower
sensitivity meter and assuming that all of the light is at the more-damaging shorter wavelength of
370 nm, a very cautious maximum Lux reading for allowable 8-hour exposure is:

We believe that this is a cautious guideline because if we take the UV meter outdoors in bright
sunlight, we usually get readings in excess of 1500 Lux, which is more than ten times greater than
145 Lux."

A. IFX CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS 
 
The IFX instrument acquires signals from 24 photo diodes, 2 temperature probes, and several 
miscellaneous voltages and currents. Power is provided from standard 180vac WTS power. 
Separate voltages are generated for electronic operation and the lamp driver. Furthermore, on 
instrument power up only the electronic power is applied. Lamp power is disabled. 
 
The IFX 1970 IC electronics consists mainly of the following sections. 
 
Power Supply 
Receiver cards A, B, C 
Lamp Driver card 
Preamp cards A, B 
PULSER/MOTOR CONTROLLER  
CPU with SINGLE ETHERNET

B. POWER SUPPLY (F197430-000) 
 
There are two independent power supplies in the IFX tool. The main power supply provides all 
of the operating voltages for the acquisition electronics and is operational whenever tool power 
is applied. The lamp power supply provides power for the bulbs and the filter wheel stepper 
motor and Sound Speed transducer. 
 
The main supply consists of power transformer T1, rectifiers BR1 & BR2, filter chokes L1 and 
L2, and the main regulator board. Output voltages available are +5 D, +5 A, and -5 A and are 
easily measured at the terminal post buss. 
 
The lamp supply consists of power transformer T2, filter choke L3, and a capacitor filter board 
that also contains the rectifier diodes. When instrument power is applied the lamp power will be 
zero. Upon initializing lamp power with the proper software command the CPU will energize

C. RECEIVER INTERFACE (F194851-000) 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The receiver card is designed to individually acquire and process 8 analog channels. Each 
channel contains a differential amplifier front end, a D/A Converter for offset control and 
eight 24 bit sigma-delta A/D converters with an input range of -3 to +3 V. The present IFX 
tool uses 3 receiver cards totaling 24 analog channels. 
 
2. Circuit Description 
 
Each card has its own power on reset IC to reset the D/A and A/D converters. A 10 MHz 
oscillator is used to provide a clock for the A/D, FPGA, and D/A. A single Actel chip 
provides a Synchronous Serial Interface to the CPU card as well as all state machine timing 
and control for each of the A /Ds. A common Sync line is provided by the CPU to each of 
the receiver cards and subsequently to each of the A/Ds. It is important that all of the 
internal clocks on the 24 A/Ds are synchronized so that transmission of data to the CPU 
does not “time out”. 
 
Each of the 3 receiver cards is identical and can be readily swapped with each other. 
Address selection jumpers are installed on each of the chassis connectors and are read by 
the card during power up. Digital inputs to each card are buffered by a 74 HC04 hex 
Schmidt trigger. Outputs are driven by an octal 74 HC244 line driver. Communication to the 
CPU is through a synchronous serial protocol consisting of a common clock and individual 
Tx and Rx data lines. 
 
Eight sigma-delta A/Ds are used to synchronously acquire the input signals. Each A/D 
converter has 2 channels. Channel 1 is connected to the output of its corresponding 
differential amp and represents the Voltage produced by the photo diode. Channel 2 is 
connected directly to the output of its corresponding D/A, and is used in test mode. 
 
Eight D/A converters are provided and are configured to inject a DC offset voltage into its 
respective input amplifier. This injected voltage is used in two ways. First in “test mode” 
this voltage is sampled by channel 2 of its corresponding A/D and is used to trouble shoot 
or verify A/D operation. Second, in “log mode” this voltage “bucks out” any negative 
offset present at each photo diode, especially, at higher temperatures.

document (P/N 194898-000)

D. MULTI LAMP INTERFACE (A3002241-000) 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The lamp driver card has the capability to selectively drive four lamps with up to 1.5 Amps 
@ 8 V and two UV LEDs.  The present IFX tool has two lamps but only one lamp is 
illuminated at a time. The third lamp driver circuit drives an Ultra violet Light Emitting 
Diode. The fourth lamp driver circuit drives a resistor load and is used to dynamically 
maintain a constant current load regardless of whether the bulb or the LED is on or off. 
This “load balancing” is necessary to maintain a constant cablehead voltage under the 
changing load conditions of the IFX. When the bulb and the UV LED are off, the resistor 
load shunts the current that previously went to the bulb. When a lamp is fully ON, the 
resistor load will be supplied minimum current. Similar load balancing is executed when 
the UV LED is ON.  
 
An interlocking protection circuit is incorporated in the UV LED drive circuit to protect the 
user from UV radiation. Hall Effect device assembly 198190-000 sense the presence of the 
top, A3000215-000 and bottom A3000216-000 covers and enable the lamp driver circuit to 
power the UV LEDs. The drive circuit will also be disabled if there is break in the wiring to 
the Hall Device assembly from the lamp driver card.  
 
2. Circuit Description 
 
Address selection jumpers are installed on the chassis connector and are read by the card 
during power up. Digital inputs to the lamp driver card are buffered by a 74 HC04 hex 
Schmidt trigger. Outputs are driven by an octal 74 HC244 line driver. Communication to the 
CPU is through a synchronous serial protocol consisting of a common clock and individual 
Tx and Rx data lines. 
 
A single Actel chip provides a Synchronous Serial Interface to the CPU card as well as all 
state machine timing and control to each of the A /Ds. A common Sync line is provided by 
the CPU to the lamp interface card and subsequently to each of the A/Ds. It is important 
that all of the internal clocks on the five A/Ds are synchronized so that transmission of data 
to the CPU does not “time out”. 
 
The analog section has four D/A converters that set the current to each lamp. Each of the 
A/D converters measures the voltage and current on its respective lamp. Channel 1 of each 
A/D measures voltage and channel 2 measures current. One additional A/D is provided and 
configured to measure the temperature. Temperature from a probe embedded into the 
preamp box is sampled on channel 1. Channel 2 converts the temperature from a probe 
mounted adjacent to the Sound speed transducer. 
 
The command and data protocol can be found in the WTS Firmware Specifications 
document (P/N 194898-000)

E. IFX PREAMPLIFIER (A3000412-000 &A3000413-000) 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The preamp board is designed to convert the photocurrent produced by each of the light 
sensitive diodes to a voltage. There are 12 identical preamplifier circuits on each of the 2 
preamp boards (preamp A & B). Each circuit however, has its own unique gain. The gain is 
selected by the value of feedback resistor chosen. The value of the feedback resistor for 
each preamplifier depends upon the type of diode, light input with respect to wavelength 
and responsivity of the diode at its operating wavelength.  
 
Each diode is wired using a shielded twisted pair wire with a molded connector. The anode 
and cathode of the diode are connected between the two wires of the twisted pair with the 
shield left open at the diode end. The shield at the connector end is connected to AGND 
(±5 V Return). The Preamplifier box is isolated from the main instrument chassis, then 
connected to AGND by an external wire. This keeps all the diode bodies at GND potential. 
 
2. Circuit Description: 
 
All 12 preamplifiers are identical so only one preamplifier channel will be described. 
Consider channel 10. The diode is connected between two amplifiers, sections A & B of U1 
in such a way that there is zero voltage across the diode. The light on the photo diode will 
generate a current that is converted to a voltage by each amplifier (photocurrent * Feedback 
resistor). The output of each amplifier is connected to a Differential Instrument Amplifier. 
The output of the first amplifier will be positive while the other one will be negative. The 
output of both amplifiers is summed at the differential amp. The output will be negative 
because of the polarity of the diode connections. 
  
Each of the input opamps will have a slight input offset voltage. The difference between the 
voltages will be seen across the diode and will generate a small current. Due to the high 
resistance (1500 G OHMS) of the diode at room temperature this current will be negligible. 
This current will increase as temperature increases due to change in resistance of the diode 
and input offset voltage of the amplifiers. The difference in the bias currents of the two 
amplifiers will increase as temperature increases. But, since they are fed into opposite 
polarities of the differential amplifier they will cancel. The currents are produced even

The IFX CPU with SINGLE ETHERNET is the main CPU board for the 1970 IC Sample 
View instrument.  It is capable of emulating the 1970 IB CPU board with many added 
features.  It provides the WTS instrument Buss interface and the Synchronous Serial Buss 
used to communicate with the 24 optical A/D channels and 5 channels of the Lamp driver 
board.  It also controls the stepper motor drive for the optic filter wheel.  Features available 
on this CPU board include two RS-232 level asynchronous serial ports, a 10baseT Ethernet

2. Circuit Description Boot-up 
 
The CPU is clocked from a 40 MHz oscillator multiplied internally to run the core at 120 
MHZ. The external data bus runs at 40 MHz.   The executable firmware resides in a 256 K 
byte flash memory (128 K by 16 bit).  At boot up, the CPU transfers the executable from 
flash to the 256 K byte SRAM (64 K by 32) for faster execution. At boot up, the CPU 
performs several self tests prior to execution of the IFX code.  The progress of the boot up 
is reported on RS-232 (0 or 1?) serial port.  At boot up the CPU commands the Ethernet to 
request an IP address from a DHCP server.  If the tool is not connected to a DHCP server 
then the request times out and a default IP address is assumed.  The active IP address is 
reported to the RS-232 port. Some troubleshooting utilities reside in the firmware 
accessible by pressing the shift and T key on a terminal emulator connected to the RS-232 
port.  The Rs232 port is configured as 19.2k baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop, bit no parity and “no 
handshake”. 
 
3. Power 
 
The CPU power requirements are +3.3volts for the I/O and 1.8 volts for the core.  On 
power up the 2 supplies must come up together with the 1.8 supply never exceeding the 3.3 
as they ramp up to prevent gate latch up in the CPU.  The Sample View power supply only 
provides a +5 supply voltage therefore on board linear regulators derive the necessary 
voltages locally for the CPU and the Actel FPGA.  The +3.3volt digital logic supply is 
derived by a resistor divider network across the +5 volt supply, buffered by op amp U27 
driving series pass element FET Q1. The 1.8 volt CPU core supply is derived by a resistor 
divider network across the +5 volt supply, buffered by op amp U29 driving series pass 
element FET Q3.  Since its reference is from the 3.3 volt supply it should never exceed the 
3.3 volt at ramp up. The diode network of D5, D6, D7 limit the voltage separation during 
ramp up and diode D12 force them to track each other during power down.  The 2.5 volt 
Actel core supply is derived from a resistor divider network across the +5 volt supply, 
buffered by op amp U28 driving series pass element FET Q2.  The +5 volt supply, +3.3 
volt supply and the 1.8 volt supply are monitored by supply supervisor U1 to provide reset 
to the CPU. 
 
4. Reset 
 
The CPU requires its internal PLL time to stabilize before the boot up process begins. The 
CPU must be clock for a minimum of 2 clock cycles before the CPU reset input is released.  
The RESET OUT (RSTO) of the CPU is release 50 clock cycles after CPU reset giving the 
internal PLL sufficient time to stabilize.  The RSTO output is used to hold the FPGA reset 
which holds the system reset.  During reset the Motorola 5407 CPU configures its initial 
operating conditions from data bus D0 through D7.  These data lines are driven by tri-state 
buffer U7 while RESET is active. The configuration jumpers JP1 through JP8 define the 
desired boot up operating conditions of the CPU.  These jumpers are presented to the CPU 
only during the reset condition.  These jumpers define the source of boot code, boot data 
width, number of wait states, clock scaling rates and programmable parallel port bits 
definition.  Standard configuration for this board is JP3 and JP5 shorted; JP1, JP2, JP4, JP6, 
JP7, JP8 are open.  This defines the boot source as 16 bit wide data from the flash memory 
address with 15 wait states, a clock scale of 3 X and the parallel port bits are programmed 
initially as inputs

5. Memory Map 
 
The Motorola 5407 has eight programmable Chip Select lines (CS0 through CS7).  CS0 is 
the global chip select used for the boot memory chip select with 15 wait states and Auto-
acknowledge.  The other chip selects must be programmed to define their address 
assignments.  This board uses CS0 as the chip select for the flash memory U6 (1 M by 16), 
CS2 is defined as the enable with auto-acknowledge for SRAM U7 (512 K by 32), CS6 is 
dedicated to the Ethernet controller with external acknowledge, and CS7 is dedicated to the 
FPGA with external acknowledge. The remaining Chip Select lines are not used.   
 
Chip selects configured for external acknowledge require a Transfer Acknowledge (signal 
TA) pulse to terminate the I/O cycle.  The CPU will hold the read or write I/O cycle active 
until the responding device acknowledges the data transfer by asserting TA active low.  An 
external acknowledge permits the I/O device to govern the I/O cycle termination timing.  A 
time out circuit in the FPGA monitors I/O cycles for CS6/ and CS7/ and TA.  If a TA does 
not occur in a reasonable time period then the time out circuit artificially generates TA to 
prevent I/O cycle hang up. The timeout period for the time out generated TA is 800 micro 
seconds. 
 
6. FPGA 
 
The ACTEL APA150 (U19) is the glue logic for the system. The FPGA is an “in circuit” 
programmable, flash memory base device.  Connector J9 is provided for programming the 
device. A significant portion of the devise logic is un-used.  It also contains dedicated 
memory modules that are not used at this time.  More features could be added in the future. 
Programming software, programmers and connection adapters are available from 
Actel.U19 contains status and configuration or control registers for each function designed 
into the FPGA.  The functions are Ethernet control decoding, Serial Bus control, Filter 
Wheel Motor control, Parallel port control, Interrupt multiplexer and mask register, Mode 2 
Manchester encoder, Mode 2 decoder, Mode 5 Manchester encoder and Mode 7 
Manchester encoder.  
 
Only Ethernet’s control functions are gated through the FPGA.  Ethernet data and 
addressing is directly from the CPU I/O bus. The Davicom DM9008 Ethernet controller 
was intended for the P.C. environment. It has individual read and write control lines, a high 
active reset and IRQ and a low active Address Latch Enable (ALE).  It also uses the signal 
IOCHRY (low active) to extend read and write I/O cycles to insure data transfer integrity.  
The Motorola 5407 has a single Read/Write line (high= read, low = write), a low active 
reset, IRQ, Chip Select and Address Strobe. The Motorola can use a pulsed input signal 
TA/ low active to indicate the transfer is complete.  The Ethernet circuitry in the FPGA 
translates the discrepancies in control functions between the two chips.  The CS6/ and 
Read/Write from the CPU are used to create a low active ALE/ and either ENET _RD/ or 
ENET_WR/.  The Ethernet chip asserts IOCHRDY low to extend the duration of the read 
or write cycle as needed to ensure data transfer. If IOCHRDY does not asset low or if it 
asserts low then returns high the logic causes TA/ to pulse low to the CPU to terminate the 
I/O cycle. The Ethernet controller is held reset by ENET_RST being forced high at power 
up.  The CPU will write to the control register to de-assert ENET_RST (low) after boot up 
is complete. The Ethernet IRQ signal is inverted and presented to the interrupt multiplexer 
and mask register in the FPGA. The firmware will command which IRQ signal will be used

The Serial Bus is the CPU’s means of communicating with the optical functions of the IFX.  
The Serial Bus (S BUS) consists of a parallel to serial converter to transmit data and a serial 
to parallel converter to received data from the Lamp Driver, and A/D boards. The main 
clock is divided down to 1 MHz for the Serial Clock to the S Bus.  The SCLK signal is 
used for transmit and receive during optical data acquisition.  The signal SDATAOUT is 
the transmitted data and is framed by SGATEOUT.  The signal SDATAIN is received data 
and is framed by SGATEIN.   SCLK is gated off during Tuning Fork or Sound Speed 
acquisitions to reduce system noise on the low level analog signals. 
 
The Filter Wheel Motor is controlled through the S bus configuration register.  Three of the 
control bits in the register correlate to three signals MOTO1, MOTO2 and MOTO3.  The 
CPU writes to the SBUS configuration register setting or clearing the bits to sequence the 
signals to step the motor.  The micro switch on the Filter Wheel provides position feedback 
in the form of an INDEX signal.  The falling edge of INDEX is captured and synchronized 
with internal clocks to create an interrupt if enabled.  The input signal INDEX is the most 
significant bit of the S BUS status word

7. Parallel Port Control 
 
The Parallel Port is a custom 16 bit parallel interface creating a bus intended to facilitate 
the stacking of up to 7 peripheral printed circuit boards above and below the host CPU.  
The CPU board has a 50 pin connector on the top of the board and a 50 socket connector on 
the bottom of the board.  Each peripheral should have a similar connector and mounting 
hole configuration to accommodate stacking of boards.  The parallel bus can be extended 
with cables to adjacent chassis locations.  
 
The parallel port has three latched Chip Select signals (PPCS0, PPCS1 and PPCS2) to 
enable a peripheral to respond to the bus.  Each peripheral will compare the combination of 
Chip Selects to their on board address jumpers.  Only the peripheral with matching address 
jumpers can respond to bus cycles.  A Chip Select of ‘000” is reserved to provide an 
inactive bus.  The port also has five latched address lines (PPA0-PPA4) to select the target 
register or function in the selected peripheral. The chip selects and address signals remain 
active once latch until the CPU selects another peripheral. This permits the CPU to perform 
multiple reads or writes to a selected function with out having to readdress the function.  
The bus has individual read (PP_RD/) and write (P_WR/) control lines to define the 
direction in I/O cycles. Each I/O cycle must be terminated by an Acknowledge (T_ACK, @ 
TP43) from the responding peripheral.  If the peripheral does not provide the acknowledge, 
an internal “time out” circuit will provide an artificial acknowledge after 800 micro seconds 
and set a timeout flag in the status register.   
 
The port has three inputs for interrupts from peripherals.  The signals ATTEN1, ATTEN2 
and ATTEN3 are individual “wired OR’ signals each with a pull up resistor on the CPU 
board.  Each of the interrupt signals is captured on a falling edge and synchronized with 
internal clocks.  The latched interrupts are presented to a multiplexer and can be 
programmed to drive any of the 4 CPU interrupt signals (IRQ1, IRQ3, IRQ5 and IRQ7).  
The CPU has control over a MASK register to independently block interrupts from 
reaching the CPU board.  This allows the interrupt to be queued either in the peripheral or 
in the FPGA.  The CPU must clear the interrupt in the peripheral and in the MASK register.  
The CPU also has the ability to force any of the CPU interrupts active through an interrupt 
preset register.  
 
The FPGA also provides a parallel port reset (PP_RST/) to allow the CPU to reset the 
peripheral by setting the reset bit in the control register or to force the peripheral reset if the 
CPUs supervisor resets the system. 
 
8. M2 Decode 
 
The WTS Mode 2 Decoder mimics a Harris 6408 Manchester decoder and is completely 
contained in the FPGA. The UDI input is shifted in and decoded.  If the tool address field 
matches IFX address (5 D) then an interrupt is generated and the command is held in the 
M2 data register until the CPU can read the data.  The Manchester status (NVM, CDS, 
PARITY, BUSY etc.) is held in the M2 status register. The Mode 2 control register

NOVEMBER 2011 
The Mode 2 Encoder mimics a Harris 6408 Manchester encoder and is completely 
contained in the FPGA.  The outputs signals BZO and BOO are present at Test Points TP3 
and TP4.  The encoder control register containing the Sync Select and speed select bits is 
shared with the encoder.  The CPU writes a word to the encoder.  The encoder will begin to 
transmit a Data Sync followed by shifting of the data out in Manchester format and attach a 
parity bit a the 40.1 KHz. 
 
9. M5 Decode 
 
The Mode 5 Manchester encoder mimics a Harris 6409 Manchester encoder and is 
completely contained in the FPGA. When the CPU writes to the Mode 5 data register. The 
encoder begins to output the preamble followed by the data word.  After each word is 
shifted out an interrupt is generated on the selected IRQ to alert CPU to write the next 
word.  The data continues to shift out as long as the CPU continues to write to the mode 5 
data register.  If the data register is allowed to empty the encoder will close the data frame. 
The outputs signals M5 BZO and M5 BOO are present at Test Point TP10 and TP11 
 
10. M7 Decode 
 
The Mode 7 Manchester encoder mimics a Harris 6409 Manchester encoder and is 
completely contained in the FPGA. When the CPU writes to the Mode 7 data register. The 
encoder begins to output the preamble followed by the data word.  After each word is 
shifted out an interrupt is generated on the selected IRQ to alert CPU to write the next 
word.  The data continues to shift out as long as the CPU continues to write to the mode 7 
data register.  If the data register is allowed to empty the encoder will close the data frame. 
The outputs signals M7 BZO and M7 BOO are present at Test Point TP14 and TP15. 
 
11. WTS Instrument Buss 
 
The 1970 IC Sample view is a WTS instrument and must conform to all WTS protocol.  It 
receives commands from Mode 2 and responses on Mode 2 and Mode 5.  The WTS MODE 
2 Command differential input is present at Test Point TP5 and TP6.  A Mode 2 Command 
receiver made up of modal transformer T2 and line receiver U16 convert the differential 
signal to singled ended, 3.3 volt level.  The received command is presented to Test Point 
TP7 and feed into the FPGA’s M2_UDI input. The Mode 2 decoder inside the FPGA 
decodes the address field and latches the command byte.  If the address field matches the 
tool address, the FPGA will interrupt the CPU on the programmed IRQ.  The CPU will 
read the received command from the FPGA and take the required action.  The tool can 
respond on MODE 2, Mode 5 and MODE 7.  The CPU would write 16 bit data to the Mode 
2 encoder in the FPGA (primarily Subset E responses). The encoder will generate the 
Manchester word (data sync, data and parity) and shift it out the FPGA on M2_BOO and its 
compliment M2_BZO.  These signals are present at Test Point TP3 and TP4 and to line 
driver U15.  Line driver U15 drives Mode 2 data transformer T1. The differential signal of

The 1970 IC usually returns data over the WTS bus using Mode 5.  The CPU will write to 
the Mode 5 encoder in the FPGA. The encoder generates the Sync then follows it with 
Manchester encoded data. The FPGA complimentary output signals M5_BOO and 
M5_BZO are presented to the test Points TP10 and TP11 and line driver U17.  Line driver 
U17 drives Mode 5 transformer T3. The differential signal of the MODE 5 instrument bus 
is present at test points TP8 and TP9. 
 
Mode 7 can be used to return Subset E or tool data. The CPU will write 16 bit words to the 
Mode 7 encoder in the FPGA.  The encoder generates the Sync then follows it with 
Manchester encoded data.  The FPGA complimentary output signals M7_BOO and 
M7_BZO are presented to the test Points TP14 and TP15 and line driver U18.  Line driver 
U18 drives Mode 7 transformer T4. The differential signal of the MODE 7 instrument bus 
is present at test points TP13 and TP3. 
 
12. S Buss 
 
The Synchronous Serial Buss provides communication link between the CPU board and the 
Optics Receiver boards and the Lamp Driver board. All data transfers are initiated by the 
CPU.  The CPU issues commands to the peripheral boards (receiver and lamp driver).  The 
peripheral boards respond by returning data, adjusting lamp current, or adjusting gain etc. 
Not all commands return data. This data bus is a 5 volt level signals that must be level 
shifted to 3.3 volt level for interfacing to the CPU FPGA.   
 
The serial communications link is based on SCLK, a continuous 1 MHz clock used to 
synchronize the transfer of data in each direction.  The data transfers are qualified with a 
framing signal to indicate when valid data is present on the data lines.  The signal DATAIN 
is a data line from the CPU to the peripheral board.  DATAIN is only valid when GATEIN, 
the framing signal associated with DATAIN, is active low.  The peripheral returns data by 
pulling GATEOUT low on a rising edge of SCLK and presenting data on DATAOUT.  The 
gate signal remains active for the duration of the data block transfer.   
 
The CPU initiates data transfers by issuing a command to the peripheral of interest (Optical 
receivers or lamp driver).  The CPU writes commands and data to the Actel FPGA (U19) 
via the data bus. Data is converted from parallel to the serial format using the 1 MHz SCLK 
and shift registers in the FPGA.  Data is shifted out on the positive edge of SCLK when 
GATEIN frame signal is active (low).  The 16 bit command word is contains address and 
command information.  Bits 15 down to 13 of the command word are the address of the 
peripheral of interest.  Bits 12 down to 8 make up the command to the addressed peripheral 
and bits 7 down to 0 are not used.   The command can be to set A/D gains, send data or 
adjust lamp power. The command could be a single 16 bit word or it could be multiple 16 
bit words.  In the case of multiple 16 bit words, the first word is the command and each 
additional word is data for the addressed peripheral. The responding peripheral performs

13. Motor 
 
The MOTOR output signals along with INDEX input signal control the stepper motor on 
the optics filter wheel.  The three motor signals are pulsed in sequence to turn the filter 
wheel on command.  As the filter wheel rotates, a micro switch tracks the wheel edge.  The 
Index indentation on the filter wheel will open/ close the micro switch creating a pulse on 
the Index signal to the CPU to verify the wheel position.  The Filter Wheel is rotated to find 
the index at power up.  The filter wheel can be rotated on command for calibration 
purposes. The signals MOTO1, MOTO2 and MOTO3 from the FPGA are 3.3 volt signal. 
They are level shifted to +5volt and driven out by U22. 
 
14. Parallel Port 
 
The parallel port is a 16 bit bi directional tri state port capable of controlling up to 7 
peripheral devices. The port has 8 address lines from the CPU to the peripheral to facilitate 
selection of up to 7 peripheral devices each with 31 addressable registers for control or 
status. Three of the address lines (PPCS0, PPCS1 and PPCS2) are a qualifier to enable the 
selected device on the port (peripheral 1 through 7,  0 is reserved).  The remaining 5 
address lines (PPA0 through PPA4) are used to select the specific register in the enabled 
peripheral.  
 
The port has 3 interrupt request lines (ATTEN1, ATTEN2 and ATTEN3) to allow 
peripherals to interrupt the CPU. Each peripheral has a driver (open drain or tri state) 
connected in a “wired OR” capable of asserting an ATTTENx line (active low).  Each 
ATTENx line has a pull up resistor on the CPU board.  Logic in the FPGA capture the 
ATTENx inputs and under program control routes them to IRQ1, IRQ 3, IRQ5, or IRQ7 
output to the CPU.  The CPU can configure the FPGA to force the interrupt, or mask the 
interrupt allowing the interrupt to queue the interrupt. The CPU must service the peripheral 
to clear the interrupt from the device.   
 
The CPU writes to the parallel port register in the FPGA to select the specific peripheral 
and address a specific peripheral register.  This asserts the appropriate PPCS and PPA 
signals to enable the specified peripheral to communicate over the port.  The CPU can then 
read or write to the peripheral register with out having to re-address the register each cycle.  
The selected port remains enabled until the CPU addresses another peripheral.   Each I/O 
cycle to the parallel port is terminated with a Transfer Acknowledge (T_ACK at TP43) 
from the peripheral. The T_ACK from the peripheral is gated through the FPGA and 
returned to the CPU as TA.  If the peripheral fails to acknowledge the transfer, the FPGA 
will generate a false TA to the CPU after 800 micro seconds to allow the CPU to continue 
with program execution.   
 
The port has a reset line from the CPU to allow the CPU to execute a software reset of the 
all peripherals on the bus peripheral.  See port specification document number ***** for 
more detail

15. Ethernet 
 
The Ethernet interface on this board is primarily to interface with a P.C. for running 
Test/Calibration software.  The Davicom DM9008 (U13) is the Ethernet MAC and PHY in 
a single chip.  The CPU interface to the controller is designed for P.C. industry and 
operates on 5 volt logic. All interface signals must be level shift to interface with the 3.3 
volt logic.  The Motorola processor control signals to the Davicom are translated in the 
FPGA.  The CPU’s CS6/ enables the FPGA to convert Motorola’s single Read/ Write line 
to ENET_ALE and ENET_RD and ENET_WR to qualify the I/O transfers (all low active). 
Ethernet control register in the FPGA generates the high active ENET_RST.   These signals 
are level shifted from 3.3 volt level to +5 volt level by buffer U25.   
 
Address bits A1 through A4 and A6 are also level shifted by buffer U25. The address bit 
A6 is level shifted and renamed as EA0 (Ehernet Address 0) to allow a means for the 16 bit 
I/O of the Motorola to communicate with the byte oriented control registers in the Davicom 
DM9008. All odd byte addressed locations are offset by 64 address locations in the 
Motorola memory map.(i.e. Davicom register “0 F” is map to Motorola “2 E”)   
 
The Davicom 16 bit data bus interfaces to the Motorola CPU through bi-directional, level 
shifting, tri-state bus transceivers ( U23, U30).  The buffers are enabled when CS6/ is 
asserted low active. The direction of the buffer is controlled by ENET_RD. The signals 
CS6/ and ENET_RD are level shifted to +5 volts by buffer U24.  Some of the I/O cycles to 
the Davicom require more time to transfer data.  This transfer timing is governed by 
IOCHRDY output of the Davicom. IOCHRDY is a mechanism for the Davicom to extend 
an I/O cycle if needed.  If the Davicom needs more time to move data, it will assert 
IOCHRDY low until it has move the data.  The generation of TA to the CPU will be 
delayed until the IOCHRDY is asserted high.     
 
The Davicom is capable of interrupting the CPU by asserting the signal NET_IRQ high 
active.  The signal is level shifted from +5volts to +3.3 volts by U12 and routed to the 
FPGA for gating.  The FPGA can route the interrupt to any of the 4 IRQ signals to the CPU 
(IRQ1, IRQ3, IRQ5, and IRQ7). The Davicom requires a stable 20 MHz clock.  The main 
40 MHz oscillator is divided to 20 MHz by the FPGA then level shifted from 3.3 volts to +5 
volt by buffer U31 to clock the Ethernet controller.   
 
The physical layer is a designed to interface through 10baseT (10 mega bit, twisted pair).  
Transformers T5 and T6 are custom 1:1 transformers wound on a high temperature toroid 
core.  
 
At boot up the CPU commands the Ethernet to request an IP address from a DHCP server.  
If the tool is not connected to a DHCP server then the request times out and a default IP 
address is assumed and reported to the RS-232 port

16. RS-232 Port 
 
The Motorola 5407 has two UARTS serial ports available.  These two ports interface to 
connector J2 through RS-232 driver / receiver U14 for voltage level translation.  An 
internal charge pump in U14 generates the positive and negative voltage required for RS-
232 voltage levels.   Serial port ‘0’ is used for debug messaging and accessing utility 
functions. The connection is intended for interface to a P.C. terminal emulator setup as 19.2 
KHz, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity and no handshake. The connector J2 is wired to allow 
cable to attach to either serial port by simply rotating the cable 180 degrees (cable pin 1 to 
connector pin 10 for port ‘1’ or cable pin 1 to connector pin 1 for port ‘0’).  Serial port ‘0’ 
reports events as the CPU boots up and reports received commands along with the response 
taken.  This port also provides access to some utility functions available to the CPU kernel.  
These utilities are remnants of development debug code but they can be helpful in 
troubleshooting.   
 
Serial port ‘1’ is used to communicate with the Dual Tuning Fork Impedance Analyzer 
Board (A3001762000).  This port is configured as 57.6 KHz baud rate, 8 data bits and 1 
Stop bit with no flow control. The CPU forwards WTS commands to the Impedance 
Analyzer Board using this serial port.  It also downloads Calibration data to the Impedance

1. General 
 
The Tuning Fork and Sound Speed Interface board provides a host CPU an interface to 
control the Tuning Fork stimulus frequency, selection and digitizing of the selected Tuning 
Fork and sequence of the charging, firing and digitizing of the Sound Speed.  This board 
stacks above the CPU board and connects through a 50 pin board to board connector J4 on 
the solder.  Power and analog signals interface through the 26 pin connector J1.  This board 
is powered by the tools +5 volt digital supply. The majority of the logic on this board runs 
on 3.3 volts. The Actel FPGA core runs on +2.5 volts.  A local regulator must regulate the 
+5 volt in down to 3.3 volts and +2.5 volt for the logic devices.

2. FPGA 
 
The Actel FPGA (U10) is the heart of the board. It is an “in circuit programmable” Actel 
APA150.  The FPGA controls data flow to the CPU interface, the output frequency of the 
DDS, sampling of the Tuning Fork A/Ds, charging of the Sound Speed high voltage, firing 
the Sound Speed transducer and sampling of the Sound Speed A/D.  The DDS interface to 
the FPGA is a synchronous serial interface.  The host CPU writes DDS data parallel to the 
FPGA and the FPGA shifts the data words out serially to the DDS.  
 
There are several state machines designed into the FPGA to control Tuning Fork and Sound 
Speed acquisition. The host CPU commands these processes through several control 
registers and status registers at unique addresses through the parallel interface.   One State 
machine controls the sequence of reading the TFTX A/D and the TFRX A/D and writing 
the data into individual 16 bit by 256 word FIFOs.   (this feature is not used when a Dual 
Tuning Fork Impedance Analyzer is installed). A set of nested state machines controls 
charging of the Sound Speed High Voltage and subsequent firing of the Sound Speed 
transducer and reading of Sound Speed A/D converter and writing of data into the 12 bit by 
1024 word Sound Speed FIFO. This state machine also controls the stacking of data for 
multiple firing sequences 
 
3. Parallel Port 
 
This interface to the CPU is defined in document ****.  It is a 16 bit parallel bus consisting 
of 16 bi-directional, tri-state Data lines with address and control lines.  The bus has three 
Board Select lines to enable the desired peripheral on the bus.  There are five Port Address 
lines to address functions within the enabled peripheral device.  There is a Read control 
input, Write control input and a Reset input from the host CPU. There are three IRQ 
outputs to interrupt the host CPU board.  There is a TA output signal as Transfer 
Acknowledge as a handshake to the host CPU to terminate I/O cycles.   
 
The Host CPU drives the Board Select line to match the Board Select jumpers (J1, J2, J3) 
to enable this board to respond to bus activity.  The Board Select lines are compared to the 
Board Select jumpers in the FPGA and Port Enable (TP2) is driven low to enable the data 
bus transceivers to pass data. The Port Address lines are driven to select function or register 
in the enabled board.  Then the host CPU will drive Write control line Low to write to the 
port or drive the Read control line low to read from it.  The Host CPU will hold the Read or 
Write control line active until a TA is returned or times out occurs at a maximum of 800 
micro seconds. The FPGA will generate a low active 25 nano second pulse on TA to 
acknowledge the data transfer and allow the CPU to de-assert the Write or Read to

and requires a pull up resistor. The host CPU should have a pull up resistor and all 
peripherals should not have a pull up resistor installed.  The Port Enable remains active 
until the host CPU de-asserts the Board Select signals. The host CPU can communicate

4. Sound Speed 
 
The Sound Speed measurement consist of “pinging” a 10 Mhz acoustic transducer attached 
to the sample line then digitizing the echoes through the fluid sample.  This apparatus 
“pings” the transducer by applying a 25 nano-second negative high voltage pulse to the 
transducer. This causes the transducer to ring at its resonant frequency of 10 Mhz.  The 
transducer ringing is then dampened by a 25 nano-second pulse to short the transducer to 
ground. The transducer serves as a receiver also.  The transducer’s output is amplified by a 
differential amplifier circuit on the PULSER/MOTOR CONTROLLER and digitized by a 
differential input, 12 bit, 40 mega sample per second A/D converter on the Tuning Fork 
Sound Speed Interface.  The 40 mega sample per second conversion rate is to fast for the 
CPU to read so the data is read by a state machine in the FPGA which stores the data in a 
12 bit by 1024 word FIFO inside the FPGA.  The FIFO accumulates a 25.6 micro second 
long digitized acoustic waveform for processing by the host CPU. 
 
When the host CPU initiates the Sound Speed acquisition, the sound Speed state machine in 
the FPGA controls the sequence of events to collect the data. The state machine first selects 
the High Voltage monitor as the source of data to the TFRX A/D converter to verify a 
consistent charge is present on the high voltage capacitor.  If the charge is below a 
threshold defined in the FPGA, then the charge cycle begins.  The FPGA will output a 93 
KHz square wave on the signal Trigger3.  This signal is supplied to the PULSER/MOTOR 
CONTROLLER to charge the high voltage capacitor. A divided sample of the capacitor 
charge is returned through HV_MON input to analog switch (U27) to the TFRX A/D 
(U18), read by the FPGA to regulate charge level.  Once the charge is at the desired 
threshold level or if the charge time exceeds 150 milliseconds (timeout), the FPGA 
discontinues charging and begins the fire cycle.  The FPGA clears the internal FIFO and 
starts the high speed A/D converter (U25).  Then the FPGA asserts Trigger1 for 25 
nanoseconds to “ping” the transducer and followed by asserting Trigger2 for 25 
nanoseconds to dampen the ringing of the transducer.  The Sound Speed A/D converter 
samples the transducer from the “ping” until the FIFO is full. The 1024 samples at 40 MHz 
yields a 25.6 microsecond long digitized waveform stored in the FPGA’s 12 bit by 1024 
word FIFO. The host CPU will retrieve the data via the parallel port. 
 
The Sound Speed has features available that permit fine tuning of the transducer firing 
pulse and improving signal to noise.  The duration of the Trigger1 and Trigger2 can be 
modified individually (4 steps, 25 naono-second increments ie, 25, 50, 75, 100) to optimize 
the energy exerted during the “ping”.  The signal to noise ratio is improved by stacking 
multiple firings per acquisition accumulated in the FIFO.   The acquisition cycle can be 
modified by issuing a WTS command 5 D90 with a parameter “WXYZ” from the 
Acquisition system ( Eclips or Tests System). The parameter value Y field represents 
Trigger1 duration and Trigger 2 duration in a binary form.  The most significant two bits of 
the field represent the fire duration and the least significant two bits of the field represent 
the dampen duration. (00= 25 ns, 01 = 50 ns, 10 =75 ns, 11= 100ns).   The parameter X 
field represents X+1 number of fire sequences stacked in the FIFO. The W field represents 
the delay between stacked firing in 8 microsecond increments.  The default parameter used 
is 0 F32 which represents 25 nanosecond ping, 75 nanosecond dampening, and 16 firings 
stacked ((F= 15 )+1) with minimum delay between firings. The Z field must be 2 to enable 
the Sound Speed FIFO.  The host CPU will send the parameter value to the Tuning Fork

5. Miscellaneous 
 
There are several miscellaneous circuits provide service to the design. A “zero crossing” 
detector (comparator U33) monitors the input of the TFTX A/D to provide a signal 
TF_TRIGGER to the FPGA. This provides a phase synchronized start point for the Tuning 
fork acquisition. This signal is not currently used by the FPGA.  The 2.5 volt Reference 
chip U16 provides the reference voltage and bias to the Tuning Fork A/Ds. These A/Ds 
have an input range of +/- 2.5 volts.  The IFX tool power supply only provides +5 volts yet 
much of the logic on this board runs on 3.3 volts.  The Actel core requires 2.5 volts.  The 
additional voltages are derived from the +5 volt on board by linear regulator circuits 
consisting of a voltage divider network, an op amp buffer and an FET series pass element.  
The 3.3 volt digital is regulated by U19 and Q1. The 3.3 volt analog supply for the high 
speed A/D is regulated by U24 and Q3.  The 2.5 volt is regulated by U21 and Q2. The 47 
uF capacitor on the output of the regulator must be of a LOW ESR type to reduce ripple on 
the supply output. The reset to the logic is provided by voltage monitor U23 which 
monitors the +5 volt, +3.3 volt and 2.5 volt supplies.  
 
H. PULSER/MOTOR CONTROLLER BOARD (F198200-000) 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The PULSER/MOTOR CONTROLLER is the interface from the digital controller to the 
analogue filter wheel motor and to the Sound Speed transducer. It provides the driver 
circuit to the motor, a high voltage charge circuit for Sound Speed, a trigger circuit and 
dampening circuit for Sound Speed firing, and an amplifier for the Sound Speed received 
signal. This board also passes LAMP power to lamp assembly.  
 
2. Filter Wheel 
 
The Filter Wheel Motor turns on command from the CPU board (p/n. A3000866000).  The 
CPU board provides three drive signals in sequence to step the motor, MOTO1, MOTO2, 
and MOTO3. These 5 volt level signals are received and buffered by U7.  The output of U7 
drives the gate of the FETs Q4, Q5 and Q6.  When the FET conducts, current is drawn 
through the windings of the motor. The diode and capacitor network between the Source 
and Drain of the FET is to suppress the reverse EMF induced by the motor winding when 
the FET turns off.  These three MOTO signals are pulsed in sequence to rotate the motor.  
An INDEX micro switch on the filter wheel provides an INDEX signal (connector P1-11) 
pulled up by resistor R31 (schematic sheet 2 B5) passed through this board back to the 
CPU board (connector P2-19) for position verification.

Lamp #1 and Lamp #2 power is routed on traces -L1 / +L1 and -L2 / +L2 respectively.

4. Sound Speed 
 
The network of L4, L5, C4, D7, Q7 and associated resistors and capacitors make up a 
regulated +8 volt supply for the Sound Speed firing level shifters from the unregulated 
Lamp power supply.  
 
 The SOUND SPEED transducer is a 10 MHz acoustic transducer.  It requires a short 
duration, high voltage, fire pulse to emit acoustic energy into the sample line.  Then the 
acoustic echoes from the near wall to fluid interface and the fluid to far wall interface are 
reflected back and received by the same transducer.  The received signal is amplified and 
returned to the Tuning Fork / Sound Speed Interface board (p/n. A3001505000) for 
digitizing.  The Tuning Fork / Sound Speed Interface board has the ability to fire multiple 
times (1 to 16 firings without recharging C2) and stack the digitized data for better signal to 
noise ratio.  
 
When it is time to sample the Sound Speed, The Tuning Fork / Sound Speed Interface 
board will first charge the high voltage to by toggling the signal TRIG3 (3.3 volt level) at 
93 KHz.  The incoming square wave is level shifted from 3.3 volts to +5volts by U10 to 
drive the gate of Q1. Q1 pulses the unregulated lamp power (signal labeled +8 A) through 
the primary of transformer T1. The output on the secondary of T1 is rectified by the diode 
bridge made up of D14, D15, D16, and D17 to charge capacitor C2 to -175 volts dc. The 
charge voltage is divided by resistor network R1 and R2 to a level suitable for digitizing.  
The buffered signal (HVMON) is sent to the A/D converter on the Tuning Fork / Sound 
Speed Interface board.  Toggling of TRIG3 continues to charge capacitor C2 until it 
reaches -45 volts or 150 msec charge time is reached. Then it discontinues charging and 
begins the transducer firing sequence.  
 
Once capacitor C2 is fully charged or the 150 msec time out occurs,   the Tuning Fork / 
Sound Speed Interface board begins the fire sequence.  It provides a 25 nsec pulse to 
TRIG1 (P1-pin 5) to fire the transducer.  This pulse is level shifted from 3.3 volts to +8 
volts by U2 to the gate of Q2. Then Q2 turns on for 25 nsec to dump the charge from 
capacitor C2 through R10 to the transducer connected across J1 and J2.   Next, the Tuning 
Fork / Sound Speed Interface board will provide a 25 nsec pulse to TRIG2 (P1 pin 4), level 
shifted from 3.3 volts to +8 volts by U5 to the gate of Q3.  Q3 turns on for 25 nsec duration 
to dampen ringing in the transducer.  This produces a sharp, 10 MHz acoustic ring in the 
sample line and quietens the transducer in time to listen for the reflected echo through the 
fluid in the line.  The received echoes are amplified but U3 with a gain of 2 and driven out 
differentially by U4 to be digitized by a 40 Mega sample per second A/D converter on 
Tuning Fork / Sound Speed Interface board.  The digitized samples are stored in a FIFO for

DUAL TUNING FORK IMPEDANCE ANALYZER BOARD 
(A3001762000) 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The fluid density and viscosity measurements derived from the Tuning Fork are controlled 
by the Dual Tuning Fork Impedance Analyzer board. The Impedance Analyzer performs a 
sweep of a frequency range searching for the resonant response of the tuning fork. The 
density and viscosity can be determined from the from the peak frequencies of the real and 
imaginary curves. 
 
Two tuning fork assemblies, two Analog Devices AD5933 (U2, U3) Impedance Analyzer 
chips, a MicroChip PIC micro-controller (U1, PIC24 FJ128 GA006) and a RS-232 interface 
to the IFX CPU board make up the Dual Tuning Fork Impedance Analyzer. There are two 
tuning forks and two impedance analyzers for redundancy in the event a tuning fork is 
broken will logging. The PIC micro-controller communicates with each Impedance 
analyzer through individual I2 C serial interfaces. The PIC micro-controller acquires data 
from only one Impedance Analyzer chip at a time. 
 
2. Calibration Tables 
 
Each tuning fork is associated with two calibration tables stored in IFX CPU flash memory. 
These tables are unique to a specific, serial numbered Tuning Fork assembly.  The Tuning 
Fork calibration table 28 and acquisition table 38 are transferred to the Dual Tuning Fork 
Impedance Analyzer board during boot up. The PIC micro-controller has a default set of 
tables hard coded in its’ flash memory.  These are used  by the PIC micro-controller until 
communications with the IFX CPU is established and valid tables can be transferred to the 
PIC micro-controller RAM.  A total of 4 tables are transferred, tables 28 and 38  for Tuning 
Fork #1 and  tables 28 and 38 for Tuning Fork #2. 
 
3. Initialization and Start 
 
The PIC micro-controller must initialize each Impedance Analyzer chip with a Start 
Frequency, a Frequency Step size, number of steps, and a step dwell time.  These 
parameters are from Table 28 for calibration or table 38 for logging. Once parameters are 
established in the impedance analyzer chip, the PIC micro-controller tells the impedance 
analyzer to start.  The analyzer will generate a sine wave at the start frequency for the 
duration of the dwell time to stimulate the tuning fork while measuring the response of the 
tuning fork received signal.  The analyzer calculates a real and imaginary impedance value 
for the given frequency. The PIC micro-controller will read the real and imaginary values 
and store the values in a memory buffer.  Then the PIC micro-controller issues a command 
to the Impedance analyzer to step to the next frequency. The Impedance Analyzer generates 
the next frequency for the same dwell time while measuring the response. This sequence 
repeats for the predefined number of steps, building a response table held in a memory 

CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS 
1970 IC IFX 
 
P/N 130999-945 
NOVEMBER 2011 
The IFX CPU forwards Impedance related WTS commands over the RS-232 to the PIC 
micro controller.  The PIC interprets the command and responds accordingly.  The PIC 
micro-controller has 128 K bytes of internal Flash memory and 8 K bytes of RAM. The 
response table is double buffered in RAM.  One buffer is used for accumulation of the 
response while the other buffer is available for transmitting to the IFX on request.  The PIC 
micro-controller switches buffers when the frequency sweep is complete.  Tuning fork 
calibration table 28 and acquisition tables 38 are stored in the flash memory.  The unique 
tables must be downloaded with data from calibration for each serialized tuning fork. 
 
4. Power and Signal Levels 
 
The Impedance Analyzer board is powered by the +5 volt digital supply of the tool.  The 
majority of the circuitry runs on a +3.3 volt supply locally generated by a Texas 
Instruments TPS62203 (U7) and filtered to create Vccd and Vcca. Vccd powers the digital 
section while Vcca powers the analog portion. U5 provides the Master Reset to the PIC 
micro controller on power up.  U4 is a precision, high temperature, 16 MHz oscillator to 
provide clocks for the PIC Micro Controller and the Impedance analyzer chips. The RS-232 
interface is a Maxim Max3222 (U6).  This device has an internal charge pump to translates 
the 3.3 volt level serial signals of the PIC micro –controller’s UART port to the +/- 10 volt 
level signal of the RS-232 signal to the IFX CPU.   DS1 is an LED to indicate power to the 
board.  
 
The board is power by +5 volts on terminal E4 with reference to E5.  
The RS-232 transmit is on E1 and receive signal is on E3 with reference to E2.   
J3 is used for in circuit programming and debug.  Tuning Fork #1 connects to terminal T1 
and R1 and Tuning Fork # 2 connect to T2 and R2.

HALL EFFECT BOARD (A3003019000) 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The Hall Effect board provides an interlock for the UV lamp driver.  This is to protect 
personnel from exposure to the high intensity Ultra violet light source while servicing the 
tool.  The covers of the tool have magnets attached aligned with the Hall Effect sensor. Each 
board has Hall Effect sensor to sense the magnet on the cover.  Power for the sensor is +5 
volts and ground from the lamp driver board. The signal output is low when the covers are in 
place and high when the cover is removed. Each board has a pull up resistor and the lamp 
driver board has a pull up resistor on its input.  The two boards signal out are connected in a 
“wired or” configuration.  Any time a cover is removed the UV lamp driver is disabled.   
The UV lamp driver will be disabled if breaks in the wiring to the Hall Effect exist."

CALIBRATING THE 1970 IFX WITH THE ECLIPS SYSTEM 
 
Note: 
Calibration is invalid if any change is done to the preamp assembly or adaptor assembly. 
Overview 
The purpose of the 1970 IC optical calibration is to account for and then compensate any temperature drifts 
within the optical and supporting electronic circuitry, which could affect the ultimate accuracy of the 
measurement.  During the calibration run absolute readings from the individual photo diodes are measured at 
1°C intervals from 25°C up to 160°C.  Calibration can be terminated at any time before reaching 160°C. 
 
Note: 
ECLIPS requires a calibration range of at least 40 to 160° C.  Any calibration that does not have this 
minimum range will not be accepted by ECLIPS. 
 
The path through the optical sensor chamber during calibration must be completely clean, empty and DRY 
(contain only air).  As a result, the calibrated response of the tool in air should indicate a value of 0.0 ±0.05 
O.D. (optical density).  The temperature is measured internally to the 1970 IC with the probe located within the 
pre amplifier section of the tool.  The calibration data consists of both increasing and decreasing temperature 
runs. 
 
Both SAMPLE VIEW bulbs are calibrated across a range of temperature.  The goal is to sample the light and 
dark curve values across this range of temperature for both bulbs, and compute the difference at discrete 
temperatures and then use these results to calculate optical density for each channel.  Furthermore, the optical 
density for each channel may additionally be corrected for change in bulb intensity by using a multiplicative 
factor derived from a reference, channel 24. 
 
_____1. 
Clean the inside of the housing with dry rags and re-assemble the electronics into the housing 
and secure top sub and the 40 pin connector if not already done.   
 
Note:  Remove hydraulic oil from lines if filled.  Remove Staubli connectors 
(F153053000 male, F190144000 female) to vent hydraulic and sample lines.

When each step marked with a √ is completed in the procedure, initial the line next to the 
step number, note any damage, and circle Y / N accordingly in the PM-3 Verification sheet, 
located at the end of this procedure, to indicating the step was completed. EXAMPLE:   
 
_____1.   √  This is an example of a step that needs to be initialed in the PM-3 Verification 
Sheet. 
 
During the process of performing preventive maintenance, the PM-3 Verification sheets will 
require a description of the failures. The item or items being inspected could have different types of 
damage or irregularities. In helping to describe discrepancies the terms below can be used as 
reference. 
 
Mechanical: Radial scarring  
Usually associated with wear that occurs by something 
rotating in and out of a cavity. 
Longitudinal scarring  
Usually associated with wear that occurs by something 
dragging lengthwise 
Pitting/Crevice Corrosion  Usually associated with corrosion of some type where 
pits start to occur on the metal or surface coating. 
Flow cut/Jetting 
Usually associated with an area where a high flow rate 
of fluid causes metal to erode. 
Dents/dings  
Usually associated with an indentation in the metal that 
was caused by being dropped, hit, or mishandled. 
Scratch(es)  
Similar to scarring but grooves start to appear that are 
deeper and less frequent in number. Scratches are 
usually caused by abrasion. For example sand getting 
into a seal area or a steel pick used to remove an o-ring. 
Scoring  
Usually an isolated groove caused by something sharp. 
Such as a burr or sharp tool (metal pick). 
Galling  
Usually occurs when like metals or similar hardness 
metals are mated to each other and become seized 
together. Most often occurs in threaded connections. 
Flaking  
Occurs when coatings start to separate from the base 
metal. 
Fretting/Peeling  
A type of wear resulting from minute reciprocal sliding 
motion, which produce fine particulate contamination 
without chemical change. Fretting usually produces a 
fine dust. Peeling appears more as flakes. 
Coining 
Due to over torque in a metal to metal sealing 
configuration. The metal stem or cone becomes

When investigating seal damage or failure several factors are taken into account. The 
location of the seal, condition of the seal gland, back-up ring condition, orientation of the seal 
within the component, time between seal change and the environment in which the seal is 
exposed are helpful in the analysis of a failure. Also, simultaneous failure modes can be seen 
in seal analysis. 
 
Seal:  
Extrusion  
Occurs when the seal breaks down under pressure and 
is forced out of the seal confinement. The seal will have 
frayed or edges peeling off. 
Nibbling  
Associated with dynamic rod or piston seals. Appears 
as little bites taken out of o-ring. 
Spiral  
Deep spiral cut (usually at about 45°) into the O-ring. 
Abrasion  
Appears as wear lines on the cross section parallel to 
the motion of the seal. Caused be either to rough or to 
smooth metal surface, high temperatures or fluid 
contamination. 
Compression Set  
Sealing area of O-ring being squeezed is flat on both 
sides. Caused by hardening of seal due to high 
temperature or excessive squeeze needed to achieve 
seal. 
Cracking  
Usually caused by weather or ozone. Small cracks on 
the outer surface of seal. 
Heat Hardening  
Seal is hard and cracking or pitting. Caused by high 
temperature. 
Plasticizer Extraction  
Small cracks in cross-section. Caused by the service 
fluid evaporating and removing the compounds that 
make up the rubber. 
Installation Damage 
Cuts, punctures, or notches. Caused by mating parts, 
misuse of installation tools, or machining details. 
Explosive  
Gas expansion blistering, ruptures or splits deep in the 
O-ring. 
Decompression  
Caused by gas absorbed under high pressure unable to 
escape. 
Back-up Ring  
The seal shows similarities of nibbling or extrusion, 
except failure is in area of scarf cut. Caused by 
temperature and pressure changes, or extrusion of back-

GENERAL INSTRUMENT SAFETY 
 
This document outlines the safety concern for this particular section of the 1970 RCI 
tool. 
 
 
 
NOTICE 
This equipment is intended to be operated and 
maintained only by personnel who have received the 
proper training regarding Baker Hughes services and 
technology.  
This equipment may present hazards which are not obvious 
to untrained personnel. Attempts to operate or maintain this 
equipment by untrained personnel may result in injury or 
damage to equipment or result in lost time or damage to 
customer equipment and property. 
 
 
 
The GENERAL OPERATION MANUAL outlines the safety procedures for Well Site 
conditions and the GENERAL MAINTENANCE MANUAL outlines procedures for 
Lab conditions common for all the RCI subs.  
 
WARNING: Leaking or faulty Lee plugs must only be replaced with the appropriate size 
Lee plug. Any other form of plugging an access port is forbidden. If rework is necessary, 
contact local AMO management to verify the location of vendors qualified to rework Lee 
plugs. If no locally qualified vendor exists, the asset must be sent to a location that has a 
qualified vendor. 
 
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS: 
Personal protective equipment is provided as appropriate to the work being performed. In 
all cases, safety glasses and steel-toe safety shoes are worn during the assembly process.  
 
Read safety procedures for relieving trapped pressures in the GENERAL 
MAINTENANCE MANUAL before proceeding 
 
1. 
High-Pressure Hazard. Assume that every section of the tool has high pressure in 
it until you confirm otherwise. Possible serious injury to eyes, face and hands. 
Wear safety glasses, full-face shield, and heavy gloves. Clear the area of non-
essential personnel. 
 
2. 
Instrument is heavy. Possible death or serious bodily injury. Wear safety shoes. 
Use appropriate lifting devices and techniques to move the instrument.  
 
3. 
Pinch points on moveable arms. Possible serious bodily injury. Keep body parts 
clear of moving machine parts. Wearing heavy gloves may mitigate a hand injury. 
 
4. 
Keep hands and fingers clear of the backup pad assembly and packer piston while

extending and retracting the pads. 
 
5. 
Hydrogen Sulfide is a corrosive, noxious and/or poisonous gas that may be 
recovered from the well. A seal failure could also expose the hydraulic oil to 
these dangers. See the Enterprise Operation Control Hydrogen Sulfide 
Document. 
 
6. 
Make certain all power has been turned off while disassembling or otherwise 
performing maintenance. 
 
7. 
The 1970 MB hydraulic system operates at pressures up to 3,500 PSI.  Use caution 
when testing, disassembling and /or repairing the hydraulic system, including all 
lines and pressure connectors. 
 
8. 
Always connect “Return Line” between tool and hydraulic test cart (both ends) to 
avoid blowing off the Solenoid Valve Covers. 
 
9. 
In Packer section, the Packer Snorkel and Backup Pistons extend and retract 
circuits are held by 3000 PSI.  This pressure needs to be bled off before 
performing maintenance. 
10. 
The Accumulator Assembly located in the 1970 MB needs to have its 
Accumulated Pressure, approximately 1700 PSI, bled off via MV1 either when 
shipping the section or before Maintenance. 
 
11. 
In the Generation 5 version packer kits the rubber packer fitted to the Snorkel, 
must be “Secured” before operating the tool or the Snorkel will pop out and cause 
the hydraulic seal to be lost.  The Backup pads should also be attached before 
operating the tool to prevent seal lose or damage to the tool components. 
 
The following procedure shall be followed for relieving trapped internal pressure for all 
RCI subs mentioned above.

dragging lengthwise 
 
Pitting/Crevice Corrosion  Usually associated with corrosion of some type where pits start 
to occur on the metal or surface coating. 
 
Flow cut/Jetting 
Usually associated with an area where a high flow rate of fluid 
causes metal to erode. 
 
Dents/dings 
Usually associated with an indentation in the metal that was 
caused by being dropped, hit, or mishandled. 
 
Scratch(es) 
Similar to scarring but grooves start to appear that are deeper 
and less frequent in number. Scratches are usually caused by 
abrasion. For example sand getting into a seal area or a metal 
picks used to remove an o-ring. 
 
Scoring 
Usually an isolated groove caused by something sharp, such as 
a burr or sharp tool (metal pick). 
 
Galling 
Usually occurs when like metals or similar hardness metals are 
mated to each other and become seized together. Most often 
occurs in threaded connections. 
 
Flaking 
Occurs when coatings start to separate from the base metal. 
 
Fretting/Peeling 
A type of wear resulting from minute reciprocal sliding motion 
which produces fine particulate contamination without 
chemical change. 
 
Fretting  
Usually produces a fine dust. Peeling appears more as flakes. 
 
Coining 
Due to over torque in a metal to metal sealing configuration.

When investigating seal damage or failure several factors are taken into account. The location of the 
seal, condition of the seal gland, back-up ring condition, orientation of the seal within the component, 
time between seal change and the environment in which the seal is exposed are helpful in the analysis of 
a failure. Also, simultaneous failure modes can be seen in seal analysis. 
 
Seal: Extrusion 
Occurs when the seal breaks down under pressure and is forced out 
of the seal confinement. The seal will have frayed or edges peeling 
off. 
 
Nibbling 
Associated with dynamic rod or piston seals. Appears as little bites 
taken out of o-ring.  
 
Spiral 
Deep spiral cut (usually at about 451) into the O-ring.  
 
Abrasion 
Appears as wear lines on the cross section parallel to the motion of 
the seal. Caused be either to rough or to smooth metal surface, high 
temperatures or fluid contamination. 
 
Compression Set 
Sealing area of O-ring being squeezed is flat on both sides. Caused 
by hardening of seal due to high temperature or excessive squeeze 
needed to achieve seal.    
 
Cracking 
Usually caused by weather or ozone. Small cracks on the outer 
surface of seal. 
 
Heat Hardening 
Seal is hard and cracking or pitting. Caused by high temperature. 
 
Plasticizer Extraction 
Small cracks in cross-section. Caused by the service fluid 
evaporating and removing the compounds that make up the rubber. 
 
Installation Damage 
Cuts, punctures, or notches. Caused by mating parts, misuse of 
installation tools, or machining details. 
 
Explosive Decompression Gas expansion blistering, ruptures or splits deep in the O-ring. 
Caused by gas absorbed under high pressure unable to escape. 
 
Back-up Ring 
The seal shows similarities of nibbling or extrusion, except failure is 
in area of scarf cut. Caused by temperature and pressure changes, or 
extrusion of back-up ring.

When investigating seal damage or failure several factors are taken into account. The location of the 
seal, condition of the seal gland, back-up ring condition, orientation of the seal within the component, 
time between seal change and the environment in which the seal is exposed are helpful in the analysis of 
a failure. Also, simultaneous failure modes can be seen in seal analysis. 
 
Seal: Extrusion 
Occurs when the seal breaks down under pressure and is forced out 
of the seal confinement. The seal will have frayed or edges peeling 
off. 
 
Nibbling 
Associated with dynamic rod or piston seals. Appears as little bites 
taken out of o-ring.  
 
Spiral 
Deep spiral cut (usually at about 451) into the O-ring.  
 
Abrasion 
Appears as wear lines on the cross section parallel to the motion of 
the seal. Caused be either to rough or to smooth metal surface, high 
temperatures or fluid contamination. 
 
Compression Set 
Sealing area of O-ring being squeezed is flat on both sides. Caused 
by hardening of seal due to high temperature or excessive squeeze 
needed to achieve seal.    
 
Cracking 
Usually caused by weather or ozone. Small cracks on the outer 
surface of seal. 
 
Heat Hardening 
Seal is hard and cracking or pitting. Caused by high temperature. 
 
Plasticizer Extraction 
Small cracks in cross-section. Caused by the service fluid 
evaporating and removing the compounds that make up the rubber. 
 
Installation Damage 
Cuts, punctures, or notches. Caused by mating parts, misuse of 
installation tools, or machining details. 
 
Explosive Decompression Gas expansion blistering, ruptures or splits deep in the O-ring. 
Caused by gas absorbed under high pressure unable to escape. 
 
Back-up Ring 
The seal shows similarities of nibbling or extrusion, except failure is 
in area of scarf cut. Caused by temperature and pressure changes, or 
extrusion of back-up ring.

Cleaning & Visual Inspection 
 
The condition of sample tanks should be addressed following the job.  After 
disassembly, discard all seals and thoroughly clean all components.  The preferred 
cleaner is steam or hot water.  If this is not practical, biodegradable citrus-based solvent 
(P/N 263143-000) may be used.  The use of solvents or cleaners containing chlorides 
should be avoided because of their environmental effects, reaction to elastomers, and 
their reaction to certain metals.  Exercise care in removing all sample debris from 
passageways within the subs. 
 
Visually inspect the surfaces of all parts; give seal areas special attention.  Ensure the 
surfaces do not show evidence of defects that render the tank assembly unsafe.  If 
defects are present, or if any observance is questionable, return the assembly to 
Houston Repair for evaluation. 
 
Disposal of Residue & Unsafe Sample  
 
Dispose of any remaining sample, sample residue, cleaning rags, etc….according to the 
environmental requirements in the BHI HS&E Management System Global Level 2 
procedures and by local regulations. Companies licensed to dispose of hazardous 
material may be employed to ensure compliance with the environmental codes and 
regulations. 
 
Storage Duration 
 
Storage of a pressurized sample within a sample tank assembly should not exceed 10 
days following the retrieval of the sample from a well.  The tank assembly must them be 
emptied, disassembled, and cleaned. 
 
Sample Tank Testing 
 
New tank assemblies described in this manual are certified for service by an 
independent lab according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s code or federal 
Regulations and the assigned exemption (number E11380).  The licensed laboratory 
ensures each tank assembly is successfully tested at an internal pressure of 5/3 times 
the operating pressure (33333 psi).  All seals and valves are tested to 25,000 psi.  
Additional tests conducted by the lab include materials evaluation and certification, 
volume analysis, plus a check for proper markings and the preparation of certification 
report. 
 
Re-Testing of the tank assembly should be accomplished every 5 years; it is also 
recommended that the tans assembly be submitted for re-testing if 120 jobs have been 
completed prior to the 5 year limit.  As stated above, if during the visual inspection a 
questionable defect is observed, the tan assembly should be re-tested.  Records of all 
tests should be maintained in the asset history folder.

INSTRUMENT BUS INTERFACE BOARD
Refer to the Density Instrument Bus Interface schematic drawing 198756-100
during the following discussion of this circuitry.  It is the main function of this
board is to interface with the Telemetry.
•
The main component in the Bus Interface board is U7, a micro-controller
integrating multiple peripheral functions including RAM, internal temperature
sensing, I/O interfacing, a programming port, etc.  The micro-controller
operates at +3.3 volts, so provision has to be made to reduce the supplied +5
volts using regulator U1.
•
U4 is a 20 MHz crystal controlled oscillator providing the necessary clock
signals.
•
U2 is a 4.5 volt reference that provides a stable 4.096 reference voltage to
the micro-controller’s internal A/D converter.  It also has a temperature
sensor built into it and this signal is input to one of the channels of the A/D via
amplifier U3 and its associated circuitry
•
The tool measurements are received via connector J3 from the Controller
board and routed through U7 to be presented to the communication port of
connector J2 (or Matrix Instrument Bus) as Mode 2 or Mode 5 data.  Data can
be sent on Channel 1 through circuitry associated with transformer T3, on
Channel 2 through transformer T2 and/or on Channel 3 through transformer
T1.  Controlled by commands from the surface, U7 outputs which signal(s)
are routed to the Telemetry for transmission to the surface.
•
Reception of Telemetry commands is accomplished with transformer T4 and
buffer amplifier U14.
•
This tool has the capability to store tables containing calibration, hardware
data, firmware revision information, etc.  The Flash EEPROMs U13 and U15
are used for this purpose and is connected to the main processor.
•
U5 provides a Reset signal to the micro-controller when power is missing or
inadequate.  With sufficient power applied, this chip removes the Reset and
allows the micro-controller to operate normally.

pass the spectrum counts from the two detectors to the Instrument Bus Interface
board when instructed.  Secondarily, it controls opening and closing of the motor,
and thirdly, processes the position of the caliper arm and pad potentiometers.
•
The main component in the controller board is U4, a micro-controller
integrating multiple peripheral functions including RAM, internal temperature
sensing, I/O interfacing, a programming port, etc.
•
U3 is a 20 MHz crystal controlled oscillator providing the necessary clock

2223 XA Z-Density – Circuit Description
•
Amplifier U15 and associated circuitry monitors the current to the motor.  Its
output is routed to one of the A/D inputs of the micro-controller.  Firmware
within the controller makes decisions as to slowing the motor down or
stopping it completely when needed.
•
The output of driver U22 A controls Q8 to complete the path for the motor to
run.  The micro-controller drives U22 A in such a way that the motor is started
and stopped slowly.
•
Amplifier U14 monitors the current used by the Density Pad electronics.  Its
output is routed to the controller’s A/D. In case of high current draw, the
micro-controller removes temporarily the power to the pad.
•
Transceiver chips U7 (Long Spacing) and U8 (Short Spacing) provide two-
way communication between this board and the Pulse Height Analysis (PHA)
boards.  It is through this connection that data is sent from the Detector
electronics to the Controller board.  Data is then sent through J4 to the IB
Interface board and ultimately to the Telemetry.
•
U5 provides a Reset signal to the micro-controller when power is missing or
inadequate.  With sufficient power applied, this chip removes the Reset and
allows the micro-controller to operate normally.

routines that are useful for testing/ troubleshooting this board.  See Appendix
B for details.
•
LED’s PL1, PL2, PL3 and PL4 are used to give a visual indication of the
operation of the program.  PL3, a red LED, is used to show abnormal
conditions.  The other three LEDs serve different purposes, depending on the
task running on the processor.  For example, PL1 will light while the motor is
being connected, PL2 will light when the speed of the motor is being ramped
up or down, and PL4 will light when the motor is running, or when information
from the pad PHA’s is being transferred.

Although firmware controls the operation of the motor that extends the Caliper
Arm and Density Pad assembly, two limit switches are placed within the
mechanical section to act as a backup system for interrupting power to the motor
and prevents possible mechanical damage.
Switch S1 is placed such that it will trip when movement of the Power Nut
reaches a fully closed position for the two arms.
Similarly, switch S2 is placed such that it trips when movement of the Power Nut
reaches a fully open position.
A specifically contoured surface of the Power Nut travels between these two limit
switches and depresses the actuating arms attached to the switches.  When the
actuating arm depresses the button of the switch, it interrupts the current path to
the motor and stops it.  Remember, this comes into play only if the firmware fails
to properly control the motion of the motor.

assembly connected to a Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA).  The detector assembly has four
main components; a scintillation crystal optically coupled to a photomultiplier, a
preamplifier, and a high voltage power supply.
In the tungsten shield, an opening is cut above each crystal detector to form a window
for returning radiation.  Inside each window next to the crystal is a cadmium filter.
The Cs-137 source in the pad cap below the detectors bombards the formation with
gamma radiation, creating photons through multiple scattering in the formation.  As
these photons enter the NaI crystals through the windows in the tungsten shield, the
crystals emit bursts of light.  The PM tube that is optically coupled to the crystal then
receives this light and outputs corresponding electrical signals.
Both crystal/PM tube combinations are housed within sleeves containing a spring that
keeps pressure on the assembly.  When the detectors are assembled, the spring
compresses and forces the crystal and PM tube together to ensure a good optical
coupling and allows for thermal expansion differences of all the materials.

2223 XA Z-Density – Circuit Description
The signal coming from the photomultiplier enters at R1, is inverted by
U1 A, and amplified by U1 B; the signal is then sent to the PHA board.
The input of U1 A is also connected to R2 and a DC negative voltage
coming from the PHA, sets the DC level at the output of U1 B at a known
value.  Through this input, the PHA can also apply pulses to test the gain
of the entire signal chain without any additional instrumentation.
R6, R7 and R8 are connected to the tube anode, and are used to
measure the PM tube high voltage.
This board is plugged directly on the back of the PM tube socket, and the
HV power supply is, in turn, plugged into it.  The male/female connectors
route the HV voltages to the PM tube dynodes.
4.2.3 HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPY
Refer to HVPS Driver schematic drawing 198751-100 and HVPS Rectifier
components of the detector assembly.  Sandwiched between the two PC
boards is the transformer that develops the high voltage for the
photomultiplier (PM) tube.
Refer to the Density HV Power Supply Rectifier schematic drawing
198759-100, and to the Detector HVPS Driver schematic drawing
189751-100 during the discussion of this circuitry.
The rectifier assembly consists of six almost identical stages that output
the voltages required to the different dynodes of the PM tube.  The first
stage has two diodes in series, to account for the higher voltage that
stage provides.
The driver is composed of an HV switch Q1 A&B, Q2 A&B, driven by
micro-controller U1, driving the switches in the proper sequence.  The
programming pads allow the micro-controller to be programmed in-circuit,
if desired.
U2 is an EEPROM, used to store coefficients, models, and serial
numbers of the detector components.  At power up, the PHA interrogates
the EEPROM to retrieve the coefficients used to set the initial operating
point of the detector.

2223 XA Z-Density – Circuit Description

PULSE HEIGHT ANALYZER (PHA) CIRCUITS
Refer to the Density PHA schematic drawing 198750-100 during the following
discussion of this circuitry.  It is the main function of this analyzer to detect the
peaks and valleys of the radioactive spectrum from the two detectors and pass
this information to the Controller board located in the Upper Electronics Chassis
assembly.
•
The main component in the PHA board is U12, a micro-controller integrating
multiple peripheral functions including internal temperature sensing, I/O
interfacing, high voltage control, peak and valley detection, a programming
port, etc.
•
U3 is a 20 MHz crystal controlled oscillator providing the necessary clock
signals.
•
U1 is a 4.5 volt reference that provides the supplied 4.096 reference voltage
to the micro-controller’s internal A/D converter.  It also has a temperature
sensor built into it and this signal is input to one of the channels of the A/D via
amplifier U2 and its associated circuitry.
•
Transceiver chip U15 provides two-way communication between this board
and the Controller board in the upper electronics.  Transceiver U16 is
connected to U16 in the other channel PHA, and allows routing of the
spectrum data through that PHA, in the event of a failure in the cable
connecting to the upper electronics.
•
U13 provides a Reset signal to the micro-controller when power is missing or
inadequate.  With sufficient power applied, this chip removes the Reset and
allows the micro-controller to operate normally.
•
One of the unique features of this board is its ability to change firmware
stored in the memory of the micro-controller.  This feature is accomplished
via the three contact points TP1, TP2 and TP3 using a special programming
fixture.  The fixture puts the micro-controller into a programming mode and
actual programming occurs through the programming port (J3) when
connected to the serial port (RS232) of a PC.
•
J3, and the circuitry that includes U21, U22 and associated components, is
also a test port.  It can be connected to a PC serial port, using a test
connection 198760-000.  The micro-controller firmware provides a series of
routines that are useful for testing/troubleshooting this board.  See Appendix
B for details.
•
U17, driven by one of the micro-controller PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
outputs, and its associated components, provide a variable DC voltage that is
fed to the input of the preamplifier in the detector section.  The purpose of this
DC voltage is to produce a DC offset at the output of the preamplifier such
that its response is linear over the entire input signal range.  If a test signal is
required, U12 will apply that signal to R26.  C33 and C34 will AC couple the
test signal to the preamplifier.  The micro-controller can also open R25 or
130873-945 / 2223 XA

2223 XA Z-Density – Circuit Description
connect it to a high level, providing a way to change the test signal amplitude.
Also, note that the preamplifier output DC level is monitored by R11 and sent
to one of U12 A/D inputs.  A routine running on the micro-controller keeps this
voltage within an appropriate range.
•
U18 and its associated components takes one of the micro-controller PWM
outputs, and generates the Low Level Discriminator (LLD) voltage.  This
voltage is sent to U11 circuitry, and is set above the noise level of the input
signal.
•
A sample of the PWM high voltage is received at J1-6, which is converted to
a DC voltage proportional to the PM high voltage at the output of U11.  The
high voltage power supply driver is composed of pass transistor Q2, R31,
R30, Q1, R32, R29 and R33.  The gain command changes the duty cycle of
one of the micro-controller PWM outputs, generating the high voltage drive at
the output of U19.  This is sent to the non-inverting input of the regulator and
the measured high voltage drives its inverting input.  This forms a feedback
loop that keeps the high voltage stable.
•
The High Voltage power supply takes its power between pins 5 and 1 of J2.
R38 samples the current going into the power supply, and at the output of
U20, there is a voltage proportional to the current consumed by the power
supply.  R34 and R35 form a voltage divider that is connected to one of the
A/D inputs of U12.  The micro-controller then knows (1) the drive signal (gain
command), (2) the voltage applied to the High Voltage power supply, (3) the
current flowing through that power supply and (4) the high voltage applied to
the photomultiplier.  This allows for a full diagnostic of the high voltage power
supply through the test port, without any additional instrumentation.
•
U7, U6 and A/D converter U4 form the pulse valley measuring circuit, while
U8, U9 and A/D converter U5 form the pulse peak measuring circuit.  The
micro-controller can then appropriately measure the pulse amplitude
regardless of the DC level present at the output of the preamplifier.  In order
for any conversion to be started, the pulse height must have a minimum
amplitude.  This objective is filled by the low level discriminator circuitry,
made up of U10 and its associated components.

2223 XA Z-Density – Circuit Description
APPENDIX A – POWER SUPPLY CIRCUITRY
The 2223 XA Density has only one power supply mounted on the electronics
backbone.  Refer to the assembly drawing 199880-000 and the associated PC
boards 198384-000 (-100 for schematic) and 198385-000 (-100 for schematic).
Along with the supply is an EMI filter module to drastically reduce interference and
interaction between supplies of other Matrix instruments.  These self-contained,
modular supplies mount on a heat-sinking channel and have additional circuitry
mounted on a PC board that is soldered directly to the pins of the supply.  It is this
additional circuitry that will be the topic of discussion for this section.
Because the power supply is modular, there is no repair of the brick.  It either
works or it doesn’t.  The only circuitry external to the module (U1) is some
inhibiting control and some additional output filtering.

Single Power Supply
See the schematic below for a typical configuration of these external components
for a single output power module.


just an indicator that a connection is made to this point.  Design changes have
removed capacitor C2 and a wire is soldered to the pad that connects to pin 2 of
the module.  The other end of this wire connects to the control circuit found on the
PC board associated with the EMI filter.
Instrument power is defined as +28 volts for the Matrix tool string.  This voltage
first passes through an EMI filter module before being applied to a DC to DC
converter module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered +28 V.  E2 is tied to
the return line of the EMI filter output.  Pins 6, 7 and 8 are tied to chassis ground
which, in turn, is tied to cable armor.  Two independent windings of a choke, L1,
filter voltage spikes on the output of the converter module.  Provision is made at J1
for trimming the output voltage under expected loads.  In most cases, this

2223 XA Z-Density – Circuit Description
provision is left unused.  Additional output filtering is provided by capacitors C3, C4
and C5.

Power Control Circuit
Associated with the DC to DC power supply module is an EMI filter module.  The
PC board attached to this module performs several control functions.  These
control functions are described below.
A +5 volt supply is generated for other chips on the PC board.  The supply
consists of a single dropping resistor (R3) and reference Zener diode (D1) to
establish the voltage.  This supply is connected to the output of the EMI filter
module (U1).  It is this +28 V EMI filter output that connects to the input of other DC
to DC converter modules within the instrument.  See the schematic below.


Refer to schematic diagram of the Power Supply Control circuit on page 17.  The
heart of the power control circuitry is a programmable micro-controller (U3).
Values for resistor R7 and capacitor C3 have been selected to give an operating
frequency of approximately 1 MHz.  Supplied with +5 volts from the supply of
, the micro-controller acts as a timer to control the turn-on time of anything
tied to its output.  There are basically three functions concerning this circuit.  They
are (1) a voltage threshold, (2) the delay circuit and (3) the control/inhibit circuit.
(1) A threshold voltage is established using chip U4.  The voltage divider
consisting of R6 and R8 are chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for
instrument power) is present on R6, the reset chip removes the LOW on pin 7
which in turn removes the reset from the micro-controller, U3, allowing it to do
its job.
(2) Jumper inputs to the micro-controller chip, U3, set different length delay
times.  Delay times are established for different tools to limit the current
demand when the Matrix tool sting is first powered up.  Delay times, in
milliseconds, and their jumpers are shown in the table below.

(3) When power is first applied to the micro-controller, output RA1 of U3 pin 18
is floating (open collector circuit).  Resistor R4 pulls the base of Q1 HIGH
turning it ON.  This state applies a ground potential to all power supplies tied to
the Q1 collector.  Diodes (D2 – D4) form an OR function in the collector circuit,
allowing control over different power supplies.  By tying the INHIBIT pin (active
low) of each DC-to-DC converter module within an instrument to one of these
control terminals (E5, E6 or E7), you can independently control its ON/OFF
function.  With Q1 initially turned ON, no power supply module can turn ON.  It
is not until the time-out function is completed by U3 that output RA1 can
transition LOW, turning OFF Q1.  With Q1 turned OFF, power supplies are
allowed to turn ON because their INHIBIT is removed.  As the power supplies
turn ON, their current demand is confined to that particular instrument.  Again,
see the control circuit on page 17.

Refer to drawing 198384-100 for the complete schematic of the Power
Controller board.  As an added feature of this circuit, Power Supply #2 or
Power Supply #3 (if they are present) can be turned OFF by an external source
via opto-isolator U2.  Terminal E8 is tied to a positive voltage.  Taking control
terminal E9 or E10 LOW causes its respective switch to close.  This applies a
ground potential to the INHIBIT input of the supply that is tied to its control
terminal, E6 or E7.  This LOW turns OFF the respective power supply.
Terminal E9 controls a power supply (P.S.2) connected to terminal E6, while
E10 controls a supply (P.S.3) connected to terminal E7.  Thus, independent
control is available if needed.  Power supplies connected to E5 are solely
controlled by the timing function associated with the operation of transistor Q1.

2223XA-ZDL-AMO,Level 3 Preventive Maintenance - 1.0 GENERAL PROCEDURE,"GENERAL PROCEDURE
Testing equipment required for Level 3 PM depends on the test mode being used to
check the tool’s functionality.  There are three modes available (1) using the built-in test
firmware, (2) using a logging system, or (3) using the Matrix Test Fixture.  However,
there are certain common items that should be checked and repaired/replaced before
attempting any of the electronic tests which follow in the subsequent sections."
2223XA-ZDL-AMO,Level 3 Preventive Maintenance - 1.1 COMMON MAINTENANCE,"•
Inspect O-rings and replace as necessary.
•
Remove the caliper pot assembly cover and check piston travel (1/2”
exposed). Clean off mud debris and reinstall.
•
Remove the pressure housing and replace all O-rings.
•
Disassemble the pad linkage so the springs can be removed.  Inspect the
springs for corrosion and damage.  Inspect pad linkage for damage, broken
pins, corrosion, “sticky” movement, etc.
•
Run a tap through all threaded screw holes.
•
Tighten all screws on all electrical and mechanical assemblies.
•
Disengage the pad arm assembly from the pad and check the pad cable for
damage.  Replace O-rings.
•
Inspect pad surface for wear.
•
Inspect all sealing surfaces of the pad housing for corrosion.
•
Inspect the beryllium window and replace the O-ring.  Replace the window if
damage is evident.  Apply a thin coat of Lubriplate over the window and the
pad pocket.
•
If necessary, remove the detector assembly from the pad and apply fresh
Sylgard 184 between crystal and PMT.  Refer to 198704-855 procedures.

bold.
•
Be aware that due to sampling rate limitations some scope waveforms,
especially at low sweep rates, may show distortions that are not present in
the original signal.  If in doubt, re-check with an analog scope.
•
Also, note that because the tool is tested alone, the I.B. is not loaded.  In the
I.B. waveform tests, to prevent excessive ringing, connect a 5 K resistor
across the scope terminals."

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE                  2234 XA WTS DUAL SPECTRUM Z-DENSITY 
SERVICE OVERVIEW

The 2234 XA Dual Spectrum Z-Densilog measures both formation bulk density (ρ) and the
photoelectric absorption index (pe).  These measurements allow evaluation of complex
formations through advanced lithology/porosity determination techniques.
Because the photoelectric absorption of gamma rays depends strongly on atomic number (Z),
the measured values of pe are directly related to the formation's composition.  The pe
measurement is not significantly dependent on porosity or fluid content, making it particularly
useful in determining formation lithology.

NOTE: Refer to APPENDIX A of the Operating Procedure P/N 131078-977 for a discussion
of Z-Densilog theory.
Features of the 2234 XA ZDL instrument include:
•
Scintillation detectors for increased count rate and improved repeatability.
•
256 channel spectrum recording on both detectors for advanced signal processing.
•
Real-time gain compensation for temperature-related changes in detector response.
•
Compensation of bulk density for variable mud-cake composition and thickness.
This WTS instrument is compatible with other WTS instruments.  When combined with other
logging data such as Compensated Neutron and Gamma Ray, the pe values and bulk densities
obtained from the Compensated Z-Densilog enable accurate determination of the following
characteristics:
•
Formation porosity and lithology
•
Formation Minerals
•
Gas zones
•
Fluid properties

The 2234 XA ZDL instrument mechanical construction is designed with the source and sensors
housed in a semi-articulated pad which can be extended out of the main mandrel body slightly to
provide optimum contact with the borehole wall.
A powerful motorized backup arm is used to firmly press the sensor section against the borehole
wall.  A caliper potentiometer attached to this arm provides a measurement of borehole diameter."

INTRODUCTION2 

UPPER ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLY
For the location of components cited in the following circuit descriptions refer to:
A3000812 WRD Wiring Diagram, Dual Spectrum WTS Z-Density"
2234XA-ZDL-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.1 INTERCONNECT PCB....................................................................................................4,"INTERCONNECT PCB
Please refer to the interconnect PCB schematic A3000961 SCH.
•
Power transformer T1, located on the chassis and not shown on the schematic, has its
primary connected to the Tool Power AC (wireline 1 & 4).  Tied to terminals that are
labeled according to its wire colors, the two secondaries of T1 are connected to the
interconnect PCB to supply the power needed by the tool circuitry.
•
The pad electronics gets its +28 V power from the circuitry located in the lower portion
of schematic A3000961 SCH.  Raw DC is obtained by rectifying one of T1 secondary
outputs with bridge rectifier D16 through D19, and filtering with C21.  U8 and its
associated components form a switching rectifier.  Resistors R20 and R23 sample the
output for regulation.  The output – at C23, C24 & C25 – is filtered by L3 and C26,
C27 & C28 to reduce the residual ripple.
•
The controller circuitry requires both +5 V and +3.3 V.  These voltages are supplied by
the circuitry located above the pad power supply.  The bridge rectifier composed of
D10, D11, D14 and D15 and capacitor C13 provide the raw DC.  Note that this raw DC
is also used to supply U8 on the pad power supply circuitry.  The switching regulator U6
produces the +5 V DC voltage, while U7, powered from the +5, lowers that to +3.3 V
•
The circuitry in the upper left comprise the motor voltage monitor.  The readings are
galvanically isolated.  The circuitry produces pulses whose frequency is proportional to
the voltage on the motor terminal.  The frequency is measured by the controller CPU,
and converted to a voltage that is sent to the surface.  U1, U2, T1, D1, D2 and associated
components form a floating +5 V power supply that provides power to the measuring
circuit.  The motor voltage is present on the resistor divider formed by R8 through R11
and applied to U4, a V/F converter.  U5 is the reference clock for that converter.  The
output is fed to the optocoupler U3.  At the output of U3 we have a series of pulses,
galvanically isolated from the motor power, that represent the motor power voltage.
•
On the upper right we have a bridge rectifier that assures the same polarity is applied to
the motor, even if AC is supplied to the motor power wires (during emergency close).
Relay K1, activated by the motor mode signal, is the motor on/off function.  Its contacts
are wired such that the motor is on when no power is present on wireline conductors 1
& 4.  Relay K2, which is driven by the motor direction signal, runs the motor in the open
direction when activated, and in the close direction when de-energized.  The wiring of K1
and K2 thus assures that when no power is applied to the tool, any power sent on the
motor wires, either AC or DC will drive the motor closed.  This is done to facilitate the
emergency close function.
•
D3 and D6 are connected in series with the limit switches, and the associated resistors
and capacitors form a filter to reduce the noise produced by the motor brushes."
2234XA-ZDL-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.2 CONTROLLER BOARD..................................................................................................5,"CONTROLLER BOARD
Refer to the Controller PCB schematic drawing A3000962 SCH during the following discussion
of this circuitry.
•
The main component in the Controller PCB is U5, a micro-controller integrating multiple
peripheral functions including ROM, RAM, timers, I/O interfacing, a programming port, etc.
The micro-controller core operates at +3.3 volts, and its peripherals at +5 volts.
•
The support circuitry for U5 is composed of U2, a 12.0 MHz crystal controlled oscillator,
providing the necessary clock signals.  U3 is the reset chip, which prevents the CPU from
working if the +5 volt supply is outside the range of 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  U3 also keeps U5 in
reset mode for about 300mS after the power is constant.  U4 activates U5 internal flash
programming circuit when pins 2 and 6 of J1 – the programming/test port – are shorted
together.  It sets the microcontroller to single chip mode (internal RAM/ROM) when these
pins are left unconnected.
Note: When troubleshooting this PCB, check all of the above functions before targeting U5 as
the cause of the failure.  Knowing that this chip is functional, we can use a terminal connected to
the test port to allow us the use of the microcontroller built-in test firmware to easily troubleshoot
the rest of the circuitry.
•
Optocouplers U7and U8, diodes D2 through D4, and the components connected to all them
form the test/programming port.  J1 is connected to a terminal – or a PC, if programming –
serial RS232 port, using the programmer adapter A2003981000.  The power for the circuitry
is obtained from the serial port itself.  U8 is the receiver, while U7 sends the microcontroller
output to the terminal/PC serial port.  This galvanically isolated arrangement, allows for more
than 2000 volts between the controller and terminal/PC without damage.  The port is also
“hot-swap,” meaning that power doesn’t need to be turned off to connect or disconnect.  If a
switch connected between pins 2 & 6 of J1 is turned on, it produces a negative-going spike on
the supply of U3, which resets U5, while at the same time U4 activates the flash
programming circuit on U5.  When Hitachi FDT software is running on the PC, the
microcontroller can be erased/reprogrammed in about 30 seconds."
2234XA-ZDL-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.0 PAD MECHANISM...........................................................................................................7,"PAD MECHANISM
Refer to Dual Spectrum WTS Z-Density Pad Carrier assembly drawing A3000812000 for the location of
components cited in the following descriptions.  Although this section of the instrument is heavily
mechanical, there are a few electrical components worthy of mentioning."
2234XA-ZDL-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.1 CALIPER POT HOUSING ASSEMBLY ...........................................................................7,"CALIPER POT HOUSING ASSEMBLY
Refer to drawing F161177-000 for details of this assembly.
The Caliper Pot Housing assembly contains one potentiometer for the Caliper Arm position. The
pot is excited using a buffered +4.00 V originating on the controller PCB (A300962000).  The
wiper arm of the pot, positioned by the displacement of the mechanical arm, yields a
measurement that indicates its current extension.
One of the channels of the internal A/D converter found in the micro-controller on the Controller
board (A3000962000) process the wiper signal."
2234XA-ZDL-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.2 LIMIT SWITCHES ..........................................................................................................7,"LIMIT SWITCHES
Please refer to drawing A3000812 WRD
Two limit switches are placed within the mechanical section to interrupt the power to the motor
when the arm is in its fully open or fully closed position.
Switch S1 is placed such that it will trip when movement of the Power Nut reaches a fully open
position of the arm.
Similarly, switch S2 is placed such that it trips when movement of the Power Nut reaches a fully
closed position.
Contoured with a specifically designed surface, the Power Nut travels between these two limit
switches and depresses the actuating arms attached to the switches.  When the actuating arm
depresses the button of the switch, it interrupts the current path to the motor and stops it."

Refer to the Pad assembly drawing A3000862000 and the Detector Electronics assembly A3000863000
for the location of components cited in the following circuit descriptions.  See the block diagram below
for major components of the Pad.

The pad electronics consists of two identical channels.  Each channel has a detector assembly connected
to a Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA).  The power coming from the controller PCB in the upper electronics
assembly is routed to the Pad Power Supply (A3000932000), which in turn supplies power to all of the
electrical assemblies in the pad electronics.  The detector assembly has four main components (1) a
scintillation crystal optically coupled to (2) a photomultiplier, (3) a preamplifier, and (4) a high voltage
power supply.
In the tungsten shield, an opening is cut above each crystal detector to form a window for returning
radiation.
The Cs-137 source in the pad cap below the detectors bombards the formation with gamma radiation,
creating photons through multiple scattering in the formation.  As these photons enter the NaI crystals
through the windows in the tungsten shield, the crystals emit bursts of light.  The PM tube that is optically
coupled to the crystal then receives this light and outputs corresponding electrical signals.
Both crystal/PM tube combinations are housed within sleeves containing a spring that keeps pressure on
the assembly.  When the detectors are assembled, the spring compresses and forces the crystal and PM
tube together to ensure a good optical coupling and allows for thermal expansion differences of all the
materials."

Refer to the Detector Electronics assembly A3000863000 for the location of components cited in
the following descriptions.  For a further breakdown of the electronics, the Long Space (LS) and
Short Space (SS) detector assemblies are A3000862000 and A3000865000, respectively.  The
PHA circuits are discussed in the next section; see section 4.2.
Except for mechanical configuration and placement within the Detector assembly, both the LS

4.1.1
SCINTILLATION CRYSTAL AND PHOTOMULTIPLIER
The crystal used in this tool includes its own Cs137 reference source.  The
photomultiplier is an off-the-shelf unit that has no resistor dividers and connects through
socket/pin contacts to the preamplifier and power supply.
4.1.2
PREAMPLIFIER
Refer to the Dual Spectrum WTS Z-Density Preamplifier schematic drawing
A3000966 SCH during the discussion of this circuitry.
The signal coming from the photomultiplier enters at R8, is inverted by U1 A, and
amplified by U1 B.  This amplified signal is then sent to the PHA board.  The input of
U1 A is also connected to R4.  Through this input, the PHA can apply pulses to test the
gain of the entire signal chain without any additional instrumentation.  The resistor
divider R5 and R11 sets the DC level at the output of U1 B at a known value.
R1, R2 and R3 are connected to the tube anode, and are used to measure the PM tube
high voltage.
4.1.3
HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPY
Refer to HVPS Driver schematic drawing A3000964 SCH and HVPS Rectifier schematic
drawing A3000965 SCH.
The physical construction of the HVPS ties the two small printed circuit boards together
in close proximity to each other as well as other components of the detector assembly.
Sandwiched between the two PC boards is the transformer that develops the high voltage
for the photomultiplier (PM) tube.
The rectifier assembly consists of six almost identical stages that output the voltages
required to the different dynodes of the PM tube.  The first stage has two diodes in series,
to account for the higher voltage that stage provides.
The driver is composed of an HV switch Q1 A&B, Q2 A&B, driven by micro-controller
U1, driving the switches in the proper sequence.  The value of the high voltage output is
proportional to the voltage present on the DRV terminal (pin 2 of J1), coming from the
regulator in the PHA.
U2 is an EEPROM, used to store coefficients, models, and serial numbers of the detector
components.  At power up, the PHA interrogates the EEPROM to retrieve the
coefficients used to set the initial operating point of the detector."

Refer to the Pad Power Supply schematic drawing A3000932 SCH during the following
discussion of this circuitry.  This assembly provides +28 V, +5 V and +3.3 V to the PHA circuitry.
It routes the communication channels to the PHA’s, providing overload and short circuit
protection.  It also provides the identification signal for each PHA.
•
The +28 V coming from the controller on pin 1 of J1 is routed to pin 8 of P1 and P2.  Diode
D1 protects from inverted polarity in case of faulty wiring.
•
The +5 V regulator is composed of U1 and its associated components.  The current is
monitored by R5, and limits the power output in case of an overload or short circuit.
•
The +3.3 V regulator is very similar to the 5 V regulator.  Pin 4 of U2 is grounded in this case,
setting the regulating voltage to +3.3 V.  In the same manner as with R5, R13 limits the
current in case of overload.
•
Pilot lights PL1 (+5 V) and PL2 (+3.3 V) series resistors are calculated such that their
brightness is the same when the voltages are at their nominal values.  A difference in
brightness gives a visual clue of any abnormal condition.
•
All the outputs are routed to the PHA’s through an RC filter.  In the event of an overload in
any of those voltages, the voltage drop across the series resistors give a good indication of
the power consumption of the PHA on that particular output."

Controller board located in the Upper Electronics assembly.
•
The main component in the PHA board is U7, a micro-controller integrating multiple

All the Instrument Bus (IB) and the wireline conductors are present at J1 terminals,
which get routed to the carrier lower head, through the wire tube.  From these conductors,
the IB signals are tapped, and routed to J3, making them available to the Controller PCB.

On connector P1, the pad, caliper pot, limit switches, and motor terminal connections are
made.  The pad wires are routed to J4, which also connects to the Controller PCB.

The third connector going to the Controller PCB is J2.  The pad power, +5 V, +3.3 V,
caliper and motor voltage measurements are routed here.  The relays are controlled by the
signals Motor Mode and Motor Dir coming from the Controller PCB.

When the +5 V and +3.3 V power supplies operate at their nominal voltages, PL1 and PL2
will illuminate with about the same brightness.  This gives a visual indication that power
is being sent to the controller."

U1 is a 4.096 volt reference that provides a stable reference voltage to the micro-controller’s
internal A/D converter.
•
The pad wires are connected to J4.  Power to the pad is routed through Q1, which is turned
on-off by optocoupler U18 plus Q2.  U20 and sampling resistor R54 measure the pad current.
If the pad current is too high, the controller shuts down the power, to prevent further damage.
Pins 2 & 3 of J4 are reserved for the LS communication channel, while 4 and 5 are dedicated
to the SS channel.  These lines are bidirectional, LVDS1 type.  Both channels are identical,
comprised of an LVDS transceiver (U13, U15), a bus terminator (R31, R45) and over-voltage
protection network (D7, D8, R27, R35 and D9, D10, R38, R49)
•
U10 and U11 are 2-wire I2 C bus2 EEPROMS used to store caliper and density calibrations /
tool hardware revision table (U10).  There are 8 tables of each type available.  The hardware
revision table can be edited by maintenance personnel (using 4509 test box and Benchmark
software) to reflect major maintenance events over the life of the tool.  U11 holds the current
tool address.
•
LED’s PL3, PL4 and PL5 are used to visually check and monitor error conditions.  PL3
signals a command parity error, PL4 a Data Parity error.  PL5 is reserved for other internal
errors.  A detailed report of any error of abnormal condition is always sent to the surface on
the status words.
•
U16 is a 3-wire SPI3 (*) serial bus device that measures the controller PCB temperature.
•
On the lower portion of the schematic, Q3 A and Q3 B drive the Motor Mode and Motor
Direction relays, respectively, on the Interconnect PCB.  D13 and D14 limit any inductive
over-voltage during turn-off and prevent the breakdown of Q3 A and Q3 B.
•
The 4.096 reference voltage at U1 output is buffered by both U17 and U19.  Both op-amps
have a 121 Ohm resistor in series.  The caliper potentiometers have a nominal resistance of
5 kOhms.  The attenuation provided by those resistors sets the voltage across the caliper
potentiometers at a value very close to 4.00 V.  This information is very useful for
troubleshooting, since any deviation from that value is a sign of either leakage, or an open
circuit, on the potentiometer wiring.  The outputs are protected from voltage transients by
TVS diodes D11 and D12.  The caliper measurement is made using two of the
microcontroller A/D channels.  R50/C24 and R58/C27 are the caliper measurement input
noise filters.  There are two caliper measurement circuits available; in the present design,
only one of them is used, but still both measurements are sent to the surface.
•
Transformer T4 and line receiver U14 compose the tool command receiver.  LED PL7 has
been added to help troubleshoot communication problems.  Command length times are very
short, but looking carefully, one can tell if the tool is receiving commands or not.
•
Modes 7, 5 and 2 transmitters have identical topology.  Mode 7 components are T1, D1, U6
and LED PL1, which lights up each time the tool is transmitting in that mode.  This provides
a visual indication of tool response without the need of an oscilloscope.  For Mode 5 the

A/D channels monitor critical voltage points.  Resulting measurements are then sent to the
surface.  R11 and C12 provide the +3.3 V measurement.  R32, R33 and C21 monitor the +5 V.

TVS diodes D3, D4, D5 and D6 in conjunction with resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4, prevent
damage to the PHA bus drivers in case of a voltage spike on the bus.
•
Both PHA’s have the same hardware and firmware configuration.  The long spacing PHA
is connected to P1.  Pin 5 on P1 is connected to R7, in turn connected to +5 V, and generates
a logic one on pin 5 of P1.  P2 is the SS PHA output.  Pin 5 on this connector is connected to
R11, which is grounded, providing logic 0 on P2-5.  The PHA’s then sense the voltage level
on that pin to determine to which detector they are connected to."

U4 is a 4.096 volt reference that provides the reference voltage to the micro-controller’s
internal A/D converter.
•
Transceiver chip U8 provides two-way communication between this board and the Controller
board in the upper electronics.
•
The preamplifier has an extra signal input, present on pin 5 of J3.  If a test signal is required,
U7 will apply that signal to C23, R21, and R27.  This allows for a very thorough test of all
the PHA signal chain; this is possible, even with the tool downhole.  When the test signal is
activated, a sharp peak should appear on a given portion of the spectrum, giving a very good
quality test of the signal chain.
•
U15 and its associated components take one of the micro-controller PWM outputs, and
generates the Low Level Discriminator (LLD) voltage.  This voltage is sent to U16 circuitry,
which is set above the noise level of the input signal.
•
A sample of the high voltage is received at J1-6, which is converted to a DC voltage
proportional to the PM high voltage at the output of U20, and sent to the high voltage power
supply driver, and one of the A/D inputs.  The high voltage power supply driver is composed
of pass transistor Q1, Q2 A&B, R29, R32, R33, R34, R36 and R42.  The gain command
changes the duty cycle of one of the micro-controller PWM outputs, generating the high
voltage drive at the output of U12.  This is sent to the non-inverting input of the regulator
while the measured high voltage drives its inverting input.  This forms a feedback loop that
keeps the high voltage stable.  U18 measures the current consumption of the high voltage
power supply.  R44 and R49 form a voltage divider that is connected to one of the A/D inputs
of U7.  The micro-controller, and the surface system, then knows (1) the drive signal (gain
command), (2) the voltage applied to the High Voltage power supply, (3) the current flowing
through that power supply and (4) the high voltage applied to the photomultiplier.  This
allows for a full diagnostic of the high voltage power supply through the test port, or from the
surface with the tool downhole, without any additional instrumentation.
•
U10, U11 and A/D converter U9 form the pulse valley measuring circuit, while U14, U17
and A/D converter U13 form the pulse peak measuring circuit.  The micro-controller can then
appropriately measure the pulse amplitude regardless of the DC level present at the output of
the preamplifier.  For any conversion to be started, the pulse height must have minimum
amplitude.  This objective is filled by the low level discriminator circuitry, made up of U16
and its associated components."

APPENDIX A – PROGRAMMING ADAPTER/ FIRMWARE DOWNLOADING/
BUILT-IN TEST FIRMWARE

Programming Adapter

Both the PHA’s and Controller boards can be connected through the test port to a PC using the
Programmer Adapter A2003981000.  The connection is hot-swap, which doesn’t require any
special precaution in connecting/disconnecting.  It is also galvanically isolated, making it safe
to use in high ESD environments.

Firmware Downloading / Built-in Test Firmware

The microcontrollers in the PHA’s and Controller PCB’s are flash type devices.  The parts are
field-programmable using the software package FDT.  Flash Development Toolkit, is free software
installed on the PC.  It is available from Renesas/Hitachi, and is included as part of the firmware
installation files.
The firmware running on both controller and PHA has a series of built-in test routines, intended for
lab use, that allows troubleshooting the tool with minimal or no instrumentation.  This is useful
when troubleshooting at the well site or in situations where a 4509 test system is not available.
When a PC is connected to the test port and running terminal emulation software (Hyperlink or
similar), during power-up the terminal will show a message describing the firmware version
running in the microcontroller, and a command prompt.
Typing a question mark (?) will display a short list of available commands.  If you type the first
letter of the command followed by the question mark, a description of that particular command’s
options is displayed.  All the built-in routines are designed with troubleshooting in mind, using a
minimum of instrumentation, all of which should provide a skilled technician with most of the
elements needed for proper maintenance and troubleshooting of the tool."

3. If replacing the motor, follow the motor wires to the appropriate connector and unsolder
them. Note which pins the red and black wires connect to, so that you can resolder the
new motor wires to the correct pins.
4. If replacing the motor, remove the motor mounts [168].  The rear one just slides off.
The front one (by the gears) is bolted on with four screws [96] and nuts [97] which must
be removed.  A new motor will also need to have the coupling half that is on the old
motor.  Loosen the two setscrews [19] and slide the coupling off.  See details of the
coupling in the graphic and text of Figure 1.




Motor Coupling
The single-screw coupling half is used on
the actuator shaft.  Set screws are
(F222138-000 [19]).  The double-screw
coupling half is used on the motor shaft.
Note the spacer on the double screw
coupling half.

The 2234 XA Density has built-in test routines – which run concurrently with the logging software –
to help in testing/troubleshooting each individual assembly.  A dumb terminal or a PC running
terminal emulation software can be used.
Physical connections:
All three PCB’s (IB interface, Controller, and PHA’s) have the same connection, built around a 2mm
3x2 connector.  This interface is galvanically isolated, allowing for potentials more than 1000 V
between the grounds of the PC/Terminal and the PCB being tested.
The standard test cable is 198760-000, and allows connecting any of the boards to a 9-pin serial port
of a PC.

Use the show firmware (F) command to get the revision levels of all tool components.
Check to determine if the tool is up to date.  This command is also a test of the
communications between the Controller and the I.B. interface, between the controller
and the PHA’s, and between each PHA and its associated HV power supply.  A null
value or faulty communication will typically show as “??.??” on its revision level.

•
Type a List command (L1), and check some key values on the list.  The room
temperature should be close to ambient, the +5 volts power supply within the range
of 4.75 to 5.25 V.  The pad current should be around 70 mA; it will vary, depending

Turn off the High Voltage supply by typing a high voltage command of 0 for both
detectors (HL0000, HS0000).  Activate the preamplifier test signal on both detectors

(I1 L, I1 S).  Erase the non-active spectrum buffers (EL, ES), and wait about two minutes
until the PHA stabilizes.
•
Now type the command exchange buffers (XL, XS), wait about a minute and type those
commands (XL, XS) again.  Retrieve the non-active PHA buffer contents from the pad
using the get spectrum commands (GL, GS), and then dump the buffer contents to the
console (DL, DS).  The following illustrates the command sequence, and a typical
response.  Note that the test signal appears as a value in channels 26 and 27 in the
following example.

Verify that the test signal is giving a sharp peak around channel 27.  If the peak is
displaced, it is an indication of excessive or low gain in the signal chain.  A peak
occupying more than three channels is produced by noise or ringing.  If the numerical

The HV circuit leakage is more noticeable at higher temperatures. Look for some RDR files
of the tool from previous recent jobs, where the well temperature has exceed 250ºF, and
playback the files to verify that the HV current has remained within tolerance.
•
If the HV current is not within its limits, change either the HVPS module (A3000977500) or
the Preamp board (A3000966500) or the PM tube to fix the problem. A bad preamp board
normally cause a short in the HVPS, however a leakage in the preamp board can cause the
HV current to increase.
•
The leakage in the preamp board is normally found in the area where the PM HV is close to
the ground plate. If a new preamp board is not available, drilling a hole (0.040”, bit #60) in
the board, as shown in Figure 5, will make the short disappear. Order a new preamp board

2334XA-CCL-AMO,Brief Description of Service - 1.0 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE,"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
The 2334 XA CCL Instrument measurement is based upon the principle that a changing
magnetic flux within the instruments sensor coil generates a voltage across the terminals of
that sensor coil. The magnetic field of a CCL magnet is affected by any magnetically
sensitive material close to it, such as the casing in a borehole. A collar or joint in the casing
changes the magnetic flux field including the flux passing through the sensor coil ends
adjacent to the magnets, causing an electric voltage to be generated.
As the south pole of the magnet enters a collar, the flux field is changed within the coil and
generates a voltage of negative polarity, for example. In turn, the north magnetic pole
generates a positive voltage as it passes. Therefore, as the instrument passes by each collar or
discontinuity in the casing, there is generated across the terminals of the coil a voltage
approximating a sine wave.
The in-tool CCL board processes the sine-wave voltage from the coil into digital signals. The
surface acquisition requests data via the telemetry from the CCL instrument at regular
intervals. The CCL instrument answers by sending data in a formatted block called Subset 0.
After each transmission, the tool electronics reset and resumes accumulating data. The tool is
also capable of storing tables containing revision-level data in non-volatile memory.
The data from the CCL instrument is processed in the surface system and converted into a
collar location versus depth curve.
The 2334 XA Focus CCL training supplement was not available at the time this manual was
printed. It will be added when it becomes available for publication.

Refer to block diagram in Figure 1. The Focus CCL (casing collar locator) instrument is part
of the Focus instrument string. The Focus CCL instrument locates collars in flush-joint casing
as well as standard casing collars. Magnets on either side of the CCL coil induce a magnetic
field in the casing (or collars). As the tool crosses a casing joint, the induced magnetic field is
disturbed. This disturbance is detected by the CCL coil and the internal electronics process
the coil signals for transmission to the surface through the wireline.
The Focus CCL has a “full” 27-pin Focus bus and can be run above or below the telemetry

DC POWER SUPPLY
The 2334 XA CCL Electronics uses one EMI input filter Hybrid and one ±5 V power supply.
They both are mounted directly onto the main chassis.
To save space and provide a convenient place for wire connections, a PC board is mounted to
the chassis side directly opposite each potted Hybrid and soldered to pins from each Hybrid
that extend through holes in the chassis. The power-up timing and inhibit circuitry PCB is
mounted on the chassis opposite the EMI input filter Hybrid and the Common mode output
filter PCB is mounted on the chassis opposite the power supply Hybrid.

2.1.1
EMI Filter Circuit
EMI filter hybrid U1 is shown in Figure 3. It should be noted that U1 does NOT reside on
the PCB but is bolted to the chassis. The power control board is mounted on the chassis side
directly opposite the potted Hybrid. This filter keeps any noise generated by the local power
supply module from getting out of the tool and contaminating the raw 28 V supply. The 28 V
bus power source comes into the EMI filter through its associated PCB terminals E1 and E2,
through the filter hybrid U1, back onto the PCB and eventually leaves the board through
terminals E3 and E4. The 28 V output on terminals E3 and E4 go to the input terminals of the
power supply.
Because the hybrids are sealed, there is no repair of the unit. It either works or it doesn’t.
Components on the PCB however can be replaced if needed.

Local 5 V Control
A +5-volt supply is generated locally with a ground reference to the 28 V power bus to
keep the tool power floating with respect to input power, As you will see, the control
board is isolated optically and magnetically from tool power. The supply consists of a
single dropping resistor (R3) and reference Zener diode (D1) to establish the voltage.
This supply is connected to the output of the EMI filter module (U1). See Figure 3.

2334 XA Focus CCL Instrument – Circuit Descriptions

2.1.3
Power-Up Reset
U4 is a power monitor IC that monitors the local 5 V supply and will release a reset line to
the microprocessor when the 5 V supply exceeds 4.75 V. A second purpose of this chip is
to provide a power hold-off or reset if the bus voltage is below 20 volts. The precise
threshold voltage is established by the voltage divider consisting of R6 and R8. These
values were chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for instrument power) is present on
pin 4 of U4 the reset chip removes the LOW on pin 7. The LOW on pin 7 removes the
reset from microcontroller U3, allowing it to run. 20 volts was chosen as the minimum
bus value necessary to insure proper startup of the hybrid power supplies. Figure 4
shows the power-up circuit.

Power Startup Delay (microprocessor)
The CCL is just one of many instruments connected to the focus power bus. When power
is first applied the hybrid power modules draw significant “startup” current. If all the
modules were allowed to start at the same time an overload condition would result. The
purpose of the “Startup delay” circuit is to insure an orderly, progressive start up
sequence. Each tool is assigned a startup time as indicated by Table 1.
Putting solder dots on the appropriate jumper pads enables the microprocessor to set the
delay time required. Delay times are in milliseconds, and their jumpers are shown in the

Refer to the microprocessor schematic Figure 5. The heart of the power control circuitry
is a programmable microcontroller (U3). Operating power comes from the local +5-volts
supply discussed earlier. The microprocessor clock is generated by an internal RC
oscillator. The frequency of the clock is approximately 1 MHz and is set by selecting
appropriate values for resistor R7 and capacitor C3. The oscillator only runs for the brief
time between release of reset and the completion of the delay cycle. At the end of the
delay cycle the microprocessor is put into sleep mode and the oscillator is stopped. To
keep the oscillator running, to observe it, or check its frequency you can put a solder dot
across JP 5. Jumper JP5 must be installed before power is applied or it will not take
effect. Installing JP5 will prevent the timer from timing out and the oscillator can be
observed on TP 5.

2334 XA Focus CCL Instrument – Circuit Descriptions

The microprocessor is held in reset until sufficient bus voltage is achieved and reset pin 4
of U3 goes high, starting the CPU. Control port (pin 18) is configured as an input during
the time the CPU is in reset the. This input configuration allows the pull-up resistor R4 to
hold Q1 on. With Q1 on; D2, D3, and D4 are effectively grounded. This board can
control up to 3 hybrid power modules. Typically, each hybrid inhibit pin will be
connected to E5, E6, or E7. The CCL only has one power hybrid and it is connected to
E6. Diodes D2, D3, and D4 isolate the hybrid supplies from each other in the case of
multiple hybrids.
The first task of the microprocessor is to read the input ports tied to the program jumpers
JP1, JP2, JP3, and JP4. The program calculates the delay necessary from the combination
of jumpers, waits the required time, then lowers inhibit control line TP2. This low turns
off Q1 allowing any inhibit lines attached to go high, turning on there respective power
hybrids.
2.1.5
Isolated Individual Power Inhibits
Startup delay jumpers and how they inhibit the output of the power supply during the
power up sequence was discussed previously. There is an additional method to inhibit
individual power supplies(Figure 6) if required by tool design. The CCL only uses one
power supply and does not use the manual inhibit feature of this board.

U2 shown in Figure 6 is a dual opto-coupled switch. The switch is controlled by passing
a current thought its input LED causing the switch to close. Power to operate the LED’s
comes from a tool’s main +5 V supply via terminal E8 and through limit resistors R1 and
R2 to the LEDs within U2. To activate the switch, the cathode of each LED should be
brought to ground via terminal E9 or E10. Part 1 of the switch is tied across the inhibit
control line BKI3 and GND. Grounding E10 will inhibit the power supply connected to
inhibit control pin E7. In a similar manor grounding E9 will inhibit control on E6. Diodes
D2, D3, D4 keep the inhibit controls from interacting with each other."

Refer to Figure 7 during this discussion.
As previously discussed, U1 is bolted directly to the chassis and a PCB containing filter
components is mounted on top of U1’s pins. Input power comes from the EMI filter
previously discussed, through terminals E1 and E2 of the PCB and finally to pins 1 and
10 of the DC-to-DC converter module U1. Pins 6, 7, and 8 are tied to chassis ground to
guarantee any noise generated by the DC-DC converter will return to the converter. Pin 2
of U1 is the Inhibit control pin. When held low (GND ref to pin 10) the converter is held
in shut down. The internal PWM is stopped and no output voltage will be generated
during this time. The inhibit signal comes from the control PCB via terminal E9. Three
independent windings of choke L1 and capacitors C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 form a
common mode output filter. Terminals E3 – E8 provide +5 V, common, and -5 V to the
tool circuits. No provision is made for trimming the output voltage.

It is advantageous to review the block diagram shown in Figure 1 to understand how the
CPU interacts and controls the whole CCL system. The 28 V instrument power is filtered
and regulated to ±5 V by the power supply section and fed to the CPU. The CPU further
divides and filters instrument power into the ±5 V analog and +5 V digital voltages.
The CCL coil converts disturbances in the magnetic field produced by the interaction
between the casing collar and the tools internal magnets into a voltage whose amplitude
is proportional to pipe size, collar size, and speed. The voltage from the coil is buffered
and presented to a mux with a gain of one (1 X). The buffered signal is then amplified
times two (2 X) and also presented to the mux. The operator can select the 1 X or 2 X
signal by surface commands. The selected signal is filtered by a low pass filter before
being received by the A/D. The A/D samples the signal asynchronously at a rate of 25
samples per second (40 msec). Each sample is stored in a ring buffer that is periodically
sent to the surface once/second. Commands from the surface control the gain and data
block transmission. The FPGA provides 2 functions. First, it encodes and decodes the
Manchester signals to and from the I-bus. Second, it generates a 40-msec interrupt to the
CPU. The CPU in turn samples data from the A/D at this 40-msec rate. Refer to operating
guide 130997-977 for data block content and subset definition."

digital noise on +5 VDC from analog power +5 VA.
The top right corner shows the CPU oscillator and reset chips. U2 provides a reset signal
to the CPU after VCC is applied. U3 is the main oscillator and runs at 11.0592 MHz. This
frequency allows a precise baud rate to be generated internal to the CPU (U1) for proper
firmware downloading using Analog Devices MicroConverter® Windows Serial
Downloader (V6.02), which is included with Hex code Zip File.

and its associated components provide level shifting between the RS-232 signal levels of
the PC and the CMOS levels required by the CPU. U4 and JP3 are only used during
programming at the surface and have no other function.
The CPU (U1) located at the center of sheet 1 controls communication to the Ibus, data
acquisition, and timing. Some components of interest are:
•
D1 and D2 are required to prevent a differential voltage between AVDD and DVDD
greater than 0.5 V during power up.
•
JP2, pin 41, when installed, puts the CPU into “programming mode.”
•
R2, pin 40 (signal “EA”) is used by the CPU chip to select internal or external
program access. This pin must be held high, internal program access. There is no
external program storage in this application.
•
Data and address bus are provided through pins 28 – 39 and 49 – 52.
•
Pins 24 and 25 provide read / write control when transferring data to the FPGA. Pins
43 and 44 are control signals for the A/D and pin 45 and 46 control channel selection
on the input multiplexer.
•
Pin 22 (AD_PD) allows for reduced power consumption by the A/D and must be held
low for A/D to run (never activated).
•
Pin 18 is an interrupt from the FPGA and happens whenever a command with
address “00” (Universal) or “67” (Primary) is decoded by the FPGA from the serial
Manchester stream.
•
0-ohm resistor R8 makes the connection between AGND and DGND.
•
Pin 10 is an output from the internal DAC and is used as a test signal connected to
input mux channel 7. It is set up as a fixed signal of 2.0 Volts and used when “Cal”
mode is selected.
•
Pin 11, 19, and 26 are the control / data signals for the A/D.
•
JP2, pin 4 is not used."
2334XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.3 SHEET 2.............................................................................................................11,"SHEET 2
Sheet 2 contains the analog recovery circuitry. The detector coil, external to the CPU
PCBA, is hard wired to terminals E4 and E5 (top left) to present the shortest, noise-free
path to the input instrument amplifier U6. D5 protects U6 from any high voltage
transients produced by the detector coil. Terminals E6 and E7 are connected to CPU
PCBA traces that run the length of the board and are connected to P1-10 and P1-5. It was
intended that a jumper could be installed between E4 / E6 and E5 / E7 to allow the
detector coil to connect to P1, when used in a different application.
The output of U6 is presented to mux channel 1 of U8. The output of U6 also goes to
U11 A where it is amplified by 2 and presented to mux channel 2. The operator can
selects either output using the Gain high command or Gain low command, when in log
mode. Should a large signal be present such as in a small hole at high speed, the signal
output at U11 A will be “clipped” by virtue of the output hitting the supply rails and
distorting the signal. The output of U6 at this time will still be unsaturated and if selected
by the operator will produce a clean signal as the log curve.
U8 has one additional input signal, DAC1. This signal has a fixed value of 2.0 Vdc
generated by the CPU DAC. The signal can be selected by mux U8 and is used as a “cal”
reference signal. All other inputs to U8 are grounded and used as a “zero” reference.
130997-945 / 2334 XA
JUNE 2005

2334 XA Focus CCL Instrument – Circuit Descriptions
Channel output selection on U8 is controlled by the A0 and A1 signals, originating from
the CPU.
The selected output of U8 is presented to low-pass filter U11 B, buffered by U12, and
then presented to the A/D (U7) input “IND”.
U5 is the reference source (2.5 V) for the A/D (U7). U9 A is a buffer that is required by
the A/D and is used to drive the A/D’s internal ladder network.
Control of the A/D is accomplished directly by the CPU signals AD_CS, AD_CNVST,
AD_BUSY. Data is transferred over AD_Data using AD_CLK."
2334XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.4 SHEET 3.............................................................................................................12,"SHEET 3
Communications to and from the instrument is via the Focus instrument bus. Sheet-3
shows the instrument bus interface for Mode 2 communication as well as the FPGA
(U13) that encodes / decodes Manchester signals from the bus. T1, U14, and associated
components provide the bus receiver and convert the differential signals from the bus to
CMOS-level signals presented to the FPGA decoder T2, U16, and associated components
for the bus driver. The driver converts the CMOS level Manchester-encoded signals to
differential signals that are compatible with the I-bus. Chip U15 is the 12-MHz oscillator
that drives the decoders inside the FPGA.
The first function of FPGA (U13) is to receive the Manchester serial stream (UDI) from
U14, decode it, and present it as a 16-bit parallel word. When a word has been decoded
with the proper sync and parity, and contains the CCL address, an interrupt (M2-INTR) is
generated that alerts the CPU to get the data. The CPU (U1) reads the 16-bit word as two
8-bit bytes.
When the CPU needs to send data, it writes 2 bytes to the FPGA. Upon writing the last
byte, the encoder begins sending the 16-bit word out serially (BZO/, BOO/) through bus
driver U16 and T2. Some signals of interest are supported by waveforms that are located
at the end of the section. See Table 2.
The second function of the FPGA is to generate and maintain a 32 bit real-time clock that
increments at a 1.0-msec rate as long as the tool is powered. This clock is read during
every acquisition cycle and sent to the surface to tag each block of data for later depth
correlation. Additionally, an interrupt is generated every 40 msec and sent to the CPU,
which triggers an A/D cycle.

INTRODUCTION

The 2346 XA instrument is a 3.38 in. (85.7mm) OD, 26 conductor powered or non-powered CCL
/Centralizer/Decentralizer. It is designed to locate collars in flush joint casing as well as standard
casing collars. The four bow springs are adjustable for optimum spring force and contain a magnetic
shoe assembly (See Figure 1). The magnetic shoe assembly contains small magnets that are used to
induce a magnetic field in the casing as the tool passes it. When the assembly crosses a casing joint,
the induced magnetic field is disturbed and the CCL coil detects these disturbances and the internal
electronics processes the coil signal for transmission through the wireline.


The 2346 XA tool is designed for multi or single conductor operations and can be used with OH, CH,
or production logging tools and has an internal PFC relay to allow it to be used with perforating
operations. The output is the amplitude modulated 2 KHz AC signal when used in the powered mode
and a varying amplitude, alternating polarity signal when used in the non-powered and production
logging mode. Two internal rotary switches select the signal carrying conductors and the mode of
operation."

Doc. No.: 130153-946 
 
 
 
1. Mechanical Description 
The 2346 XA CCL/Centralizer/Decentralizer (Figure 3) is designed to work with Open Hole, Cased 
Hole, Production Logging, and Perforating operations, in casing with flush joint or standard collars. 
The tool is 81.5"" (2.06 m) long, weighing 97 lbs (43.9 kg), with an outside diameter of 3.38"" (85.7 
mm). It is designed to be run in casing with a minimum size of 4.5"" (114.3 mm) OD up to a 
maximum of 16.31"" (414.3 mm) OD, with extensions 18.5"" (469.9 mm). Maximum temperature is 
350 deg. F. for 10 hours at a maximum pressure of 25 K psi. The tool has 4 bow springs assemblies 
extending from the sides with magnetic shoes on each spring. 
For centralizing perforation tools or other heavy strings, optional bow springs are available with 
greater spring force. A sleeve on the lower end of the tool turns to adjust the diameter of the bow 
springs and another sleeve adjusts the coil spring force. The coil spring gives additional tension to 
the bow springs. 
The magnetic shoe assemblies, which are mounted on each bow spring, contain Alnico 5 magnets 
which must be checked before the tool is used each time for the correct polarity and their magnetic 
field strength. The polarity of the magnet can be checked using a compass and a magnetic strength 
meter can be used to determine the magnets strength. 
The procedure for using the compass and the field strength meter are described in section  
130153-951, Level 1 PM. The magnetic strength should be at least 450mV in magnitude. 
Samarium Cobalt is not rechargeable. Samarium cobalt magnets with low readings are likely 
cracked and must be replaced. Alnico magnets with low readings may be charged with a magnet 
charger. 
 
 
 
 
The difference between the two magnets may be verified by placing them on their sides and visually 
inspecting the magnets. Alnico 5 has a uniform body (Figure 1) and SmCo has a layered body 
(Figure 2) 
 
Figure 1: Alnico 
 
 
Note 
New tools are assembled using Alnico 5. Some shoe assemblies 
may have been converted from using Alnico 5 Magnets to SmCo 
permanent magnets. The SmCo magnets are never to be placed in 
the magnet charger to be recharged.

2346 XA 4-Arm CCL Centralizer/Decentralizer 
Doc. No.: 130153-946 
 
 
Figure 2: Samarium Cobalt 
 
 
An optional slide collar has been designed to permit quick centralizer/decentralizer conversion by 
collapsing three of the four bow springs, leaving one extended for decentralizing. The three 
collapsed springs must then be secured with two hose clamps. 
To give additional coil spring compression, for greater force and to increase the maximum diameter 
of the bow springs, an optional split collar has been designed for the tool. The procedures for using 
it are described in 130153-955, Disassembly/Assembly procedure. 
The electronic package for the tool is designed to be inserted from the uphole end only. Both black 
block connectors are held in the tool by a retainer ring which is easily removed by a screwdriver. To 
remove the electronic package no subs need to be removed if in multi-conductor configuration. The 
connector on the downhole end of the tool is connected to the electronic backbone through a pigtail. 
The uphole connector connects directly to the backbone. The internal electronic package has two 
rotary switches that are used to control the conductor utilization and the operation of the tool. To 
access these switches, the electronic package must be pulled a few inches out of the housing. A 
legend printed on the internal cartridge indicates the functions for each switch position. 
The 2346 XA is designed to be run as a single conductor tool, if desired. Special subs have been 
designed to be installed onto the existing top and bottom subs of the tool. The only change that 
must take place on the tool is the changing out of the 26 pin connectors for single conductor 
connectors. The electronics inside the tool remains fully operational with single conductor 
operations. 
A special hoisting bridle has been designed for the 2346 XA when it is to be used with heavy tools. 
The optional bridle relieves the tool housing from the extra weight of the other tools and prevent the 
slender parts of the tool housing from becoming bent. Figure 4 illustrates how the bridle is to be 
used.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS (LAB) -- 2346 XA 4-ARM CCL
                                                                                                                                
In general, there are few special safety requirements for the 2346 XA CCL/Decentralizer/Centralizer
tool. There are no radioactive or emitted fields that can be hazardous.
General safety procedures should be followed in regards to voltage present on the electronics (180
VAC or 150 VDC) when the tool is operating. 
Care should be exercised when handling and changing the bow springs because edges can become
razor sharp due to casing wear. Also when hammering out the spirol pins that hold the bow springs
to the tool body. 
A careful examination of the magnetic shoe assemblies mounted on the bow springs should be done
before handling the tool at this point because of the magnets in this assembly which may attract and
hold on to any metal shavings that were in the well. Care should be exercised to remove any metal
shavings that are on the tool before handling to prevent possible injury.

2346XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION

The 2346 XA CCL/Centralizer/Decentralizer tool was designed to be used in Open Hole, Cased Hole,
Production Logging, and Perforating operations. The tool allows the user to connect the output from the
CCL coil to the wireline using five different methods. The coil output can be connected 1) directly to the
wireline without any additional circuit, 2) directly to the wireline with a zener diode in series with the
coil to prevent low voltage from passing through the tool, 3) directly to the wireline with a resistor in
parallel with the coil, 4) through a powered circuit designed for use with production logging tools, or 5)
through an Amplitude Modulation circuit for use with open hole and cased hole logging tools. The output
of the tool will vary according to the specific circuitry that is being used. The output can be 1) the actual
CCL coil signal, 2) a varying amplitude alternating polarity signal or DC pulse, or 3) a 2 KHz amplitude
modulated signal.

To have such versatility, the 2346 XA contains two rotary switches for controlling tool operations. Switch
SW1 is used for selecting conductor utilization, and Switch SW2 is used to select the function and/or the
signal output desired.

The Amplitude Modulation circuit (PCB 1) of the 2346 XA is compatible with the Cement Bond Log
Summing Junction circuitry in the 1415 and 1417 tools or it can be modified to work with a gating sync
pulse coming from the Cement Bond Log for time sharing applications. The circuit can be powered by
either 180 VAC or 150 VDC. It produces a 2 KHz. sine wave that is modulated by the absolute amplitude
of the detector coil signal. The circuitry allows the user to select ether a high or a low sensitivity for the
electronics. The high sensitivity is particularity useful when the tool is logged in its decentralized mode
of operation, or when short samarium cobalt magnets are used in its arms.

The 2346 XA has a relay designed into it to disconnect both the power supply input and the signal output
of the amplitude modulation circuit from the wireline any time the cable head voltage exceeds 180 VDC
and will reconnect them once the cable head voltage is lowered below 164 volts D.C. This is to isolate
and protect the electronics during perforating operations.

The Production Logging circuit (PCB 3) of the 2346 XA uses 20 VDC to 180 VDC and produces a
varying load resistance according to the amplitude of the detector coil signal as an output signal."
2346XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 2.0 SWITCHING,"SWITCHING

The 2346 XA CCL/Centralizer/Decentralizer was designed to be used with as many different tools and
logging combinations as possible. To get this versatility, the tool contains two rotary switches that are
used to select the signal carrying conductors (Table 1) and the mode of operations (Table 2).

2346XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.0 POWER SUPPLY / AMPLITUDE MODULATION BOARD P/N 125844-000,"POWER SUPPLY / AMPLITUDE MODULATION BOARD P/N 125844-000

The power supply sections on the Amplitude Modulation electronics board converts either 180 VAC
or 150 VDC line voltage to plus and minus 11.8 volts for the electronics (Figure 1). Refer to drawing
P/N 127775-000.

In the AC mode, AC power that is on conductors 4 and 6 is connected to transformer T2 which steps
down the 180 VAC to a lower voltage which is passed to a full wave bridge rectifier D11. The rectified
voltage is then regulated and protected from excessive supply voltages by resistor R18, transistor Q3,
& diode D10 and filtered by capacitors C10 & C11 to produce approximately 25 to 30 VDC at TP8.
TP8 is connected to TP9 via SW2 deck 2 positions 1 or 2 to supply power to the AM circuitry board
PCB 1.

In the DC mode, DC power that is on conductors 2 and 10 is connected through a NC contact on the
PFC relay and through resistor R3 which drops the 150 VDC down to approximately 25 to 30 VDC.
Power is then routed through SW2 deck 2 positions 3 or 4 to TP9 to supply power to the AM circuitry
board PCB 1.

The 25 to 30 VDC present at TP9 passes through choke L1 which blocks any AC voltages that might
be present, such as the 2 KHz signal from the AM circuit. Diode D7 protects against any reverse
voltages while zener diodes D5 and D6 further regulate the voltage to 23.6 VDC. Referencing the
analog circuit ground to the junction point between the zener diodes D5 and D6 produces the required
+ 11.8 volts to power the circuit on PCB1. Capacitors C7, C8 and C9 provide additional filtering for
regulated power supply.

NOTE: The case ground and the electronics common are not the same."
2346XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 4.0 AMPLITUDE MODULATION BOARD P/N 125844-000,"AMPLITUDE MODULATION BOARD P/N 125844-000

On the Amplitude Modulation Board, the CCL detector coil is connected to the input points, TP1 &
TP2, of the electronics by switch SW2 decks 3 and 4 in positions 1 through 4. (Refer to Figure 2 for
a block diagram of the circuit. For more details refer to the schematic P/N 125844-100.) At TP2, one
side of the CCL coil is connected to the analog circuit ground of the electronics. Capacitor C3 and
zener diodes D1 and D2 are placed across the input terminals to act as a low pass filter and to protect
the input of amplifier C of IC1, a 4741 QUAD OP AMP, from voltages above 12.7 volts."
2346XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 5.0 PFC RELAY,"PFC RELAY

The 2346 XA CCL was designed for use with perforating operations. To permit it to be used with the high
voltages associated with perforating, a relay was designed into the tool to disconnect the power to the
tool's electronic circuits from the line whenever these high voltages were applied. The PFC relay circuit
(Figure 6) is designed so that DC supply voltage, that is on conductor 2, will passes through a normally
closed relay contacts to the Power Supply / Amplitude Modulation printed circuit board or the Production
Logging printed circuit board to supply power to the electronics. As long as this voltage stays below 180
VDC the relay contact remains closed. If the DC voltage ever exceeds the 180 VDC limit, the rectifier
diode D12 will reach its 150 volt avalanche voltage point and it will start to conduct."

When D12 begins to conduct, the relay K1 will be energized through resistors R1 and R2 and the
zener diode D13 to chassis ground. The power to and the output from the Power Supply / Amplitude
Modulation board or Production Logging board is disconnected. The power and signal output from
the electronics will be reconnected when the supply voltage is reduced below 164 volts. R1 & R2
are adjusted for the above specified voltages."
2346XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 6.0 PRODUCTION LOGGING BOARD P/N 129593-000,"PRODUCTION LOGGING BOARD P/N 129593-000

To use the 2346 XA CCL for production logging operations, the CCL coil output is switched by SW2
in position 8 to connect the input points, TP29 & TP30, on the production logging board (Figure 7).
The transistor Q2 and its associated circuitry form a voltage regulator that produces a 5.0 volts at the
emitter of Q2. With no detector coil signal resistor R1 forward biases transistor Q1 so that it draws the
maximum current from its source. When the detector coil is stimulated and a signal applied to the input,
diode D1 will block the positive portion of the signal only allowing the negative portion to be present
on the base of Q1.

This negative voltage cancels the positive bias created by R1 causing Q1 to draw less or minimum
current. This greatly increases the circuits load resistance and causes the circuit to draw less current
from the surface power supply producing a momentary positive pulse on the line. Conductor utilization
is determined by switch SW1."
2346XA-CCL-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 7.0 DETECTOR COIL SIGNAL AND VECTOR BOARD P/N 127733-001,"DETECTOR COIL SIGNAL AND VECTOR BOARD P/N 127733-001

The detector coil output can be switched directly on to the line by switch SW2 in positions 5, 6 or 7 and
on the conductors chosen by switch SW1, bypassing both the amplitude modulation electronics and the
production logging electronics.

In switch SW2 position 6, only the detector coil is connected to the line with out any other circuitry.
In switch position 5, the coil is connected to the line and zener diode D12 on the Vector PC board
(Figure 3) is placed in series on the conductor chosen between the detector coil and the downhole
connector J2. In perforating operations this zener diode blocks any low voltage produced by the detector
coil from reaching the perforating gun attached to bottom of the tool but allows high voltages to pass in
order to fire the gun.
In switch position 7, the coil is connected to the line with resistor R25 on the Vector PC board (Figure 3)

26 CONDUCTOR / SINGLE CONDUCTOR CONNECTOR CONVERSION
An optional connector converts the 26 internal conductors to a single conductor for perforation or
other single conductor connections. This connector must be used with the corresponding uphole or
downhole sub for single conductor conversion. These subs adapt from a 3-3/8 make-up collar to a 3-
1/2 single conductor collar. Either or both subs may be used. To install the connector do the
following:
1.
Remove the retaining ring the is holding in the black block connector, using a small
screwdriver in the slot provided.
2.
Remove the connector with the proper T-wrench.
3.
Disconnect the present connector and connect the desired connector to the assembly.
4.
Replace the new connector in the tool, being careful not to bind the coils in the cable
assembly.
5.
Replace the retainer ring so that the gap is not aligned with the notch in the tool.
6.
Repeat the procedure on the other end of the tool if desired.
7.
If the conversion is to single conductor configuration, install the correct adapter sub on the
end(s) of the tool that has been changed.

The 2346 XA has two adjustments which affect the bow spring action: Bow spring diameter and coil
spring force. Coil spring force is independent of the mechanism which is used to adjust bow spring
diameter (Figure 2). To adjust the bow springs properly do the following:
1.
Loosen locknuts with pin wrenches.
2.
Adjust bow spring diameter no smaller than 1/2 inch larger than the maximum casing
diameter.
3.
Adjust the coil spring force to the desired strength.
4.
Tighten locknuts to secure adjustments."
2346XA-CCL-AMO,Assembly/Disassembly Procedures - 5.0 BOWSPRING ADJUSTMENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"BOWSPRING ADJUSTMENTS
1.
The smaller the casing diameter, the greater the tension exerted by the bow springs and the
coil spring. However, the ability to centralize is reduced in small casings.
2.
The upper slide assembly connected to the bow springs has four set screws that ""fix"" the
position of the bow springs so that they do not rotate separate from the housing. This may be
desirable for decentralized or other operations where orientation is required. The normal
mode of operations is to let the bow springs rotate freely.
3.
If the tool gives false readings or does not centralize, first increase coil spring force and if
not enough, replace springs with optional thicker bow springs.
4.
To improve centralization of loads in slanted holes, use thicker bow springs for:
A.
Heavier loads
B.
Greater slant
C.
Smaller diameter casing
5.
Decentralized operations requires greater housing to shoe diameter, but less coil spring force.
6.
If the bow spring diameter adjustment does not give a large enough diameter, installing the
optional split collar P/N 129582 will increase the coil spring length, thus increasing the
maximum diameter (Figure 3). Installation requires 2 people.
A.
Compress the coil spring with tool P/N 129565. If the spring force is too great,
loosen it with the coil spring adjustment.

2346XA-CCL-AMO,Assembly/Disassembly Procedures - 6.0 DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS,"DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS
An optional slide collar is available with this tool to permit quick centralizer/decentralizer conversion
by collapsing three of the four bow springs, leaving one extended for decentralizing. The three
collapsed springs must then be secured with two hose clamps. Also, the arm directly opposite the
decentralizing arm should have two cover plates installed on the shoe assembly."

BOWSPRING ADJUSTMENTS (Cont'd)
B.
Assemble the two halves of the split collar around the housing, loosely installing all
screws before tightening.
7.
Installing a set of optional thicker bow springs increases the bow spring tension. Standard
bow springs are 0.093"" thick. (See Table 1 for optional springs.)
A.
Loosen the bow spring and coil spring adjustments until the bow springs are free of
tension.
B.
Drive out the two spirol pins retaining each bow spring and remove the bow springs.
C.
Remove the shoes by unscrewing the screws from the back of each shoe. While
disassembling, inspect the magnets of each shoe and replace any broken or cracked
magnets.
D.
When assembling the shoes on the new bow springs replace the spacers with the
spacers corresponding to the replacement bow spring (Refer Table 1).
E.
Put two cover plates on the shoe opposite the decentralizing arm. The decentralizing
arm is the one which remains extended after collapsing three bow springs with the
slide collar.
F.
Before attaching the bow springs with the spirol pins, position each spring so that the
magnetic polarity of each shoe is oriented the same. Use a compass to determine
polarity, keeping it at least 3"" away from the shoe (Figure 4).
G.
For greater sensitivity, the rollers can be removed from the shoes, but not that this
will give more friction and shoe wear."

1. Preparation 

Verify that equipment serial number in the ZARM matches the number on the instrument. If 
the numbers on the instrument are difficult to read, they will be remarked later.  

With thread protectors in place, thoroughly clean housing.  Preparations include washing 
the tool to remove, mud, grease, dirt and other foreign material. Air dry, Blow dry with 
compressed air or dry off the tool with clean rags or paper towels. Each step of the 
disassembly will include cleaning as required. 
2. Instrument History 

Verify the SAP tcode “ZARM” equipment number matches the Serial number on the tool. 
Record the amount of PM points on Checklist document number 130153-953-CHKL.  

Use SAP tcode “ZEQFMN” to see FMNs/ OTBs that have been done and need to be done. 
Ensure FMNs / OTBs are up to date; if they are not up to date you may perform the 
applicable FMNs / OTBs before this PM3 or concurrently with this PM3. 
3. Continuity and Resistance Tests 

It is advisable, though not required to test continuity and resistance with a 5722 X* 
“WEETECH” or digital multimeter prior to disassembly. The purpose is that this may reveal 
defects that can be investigated and repaired during the PM. Circle Yes or No as to 
whether or not Pretest before disassembly was performed. Refer to step 9 for values. 
4. Disassembly Procedures 
In the 2346 XA CCL Supplemental Drawing List, refer to Drawing F127776000. Use SAP tcode 
CS11 for the F127776000 BOM. 
In the 2346 XA CCL Drawing List refer to Wiring Diagram F127775000.

2436XA-CN-AMO,Instrument Operating Procedures - 1.0 SERVICE OVERVIEW .................................................................................................. 5,"SERVICE OVERVIEW
The 2436 XA Focus Compensated Neutron (CN) Instrument is an all-new design. Although
new, years of CN design experience went into its development.
The 2436 XA CN is shorter and lighter than previous CN instruments, and is designed to
operate in a non-H2 S environment where temperature and pressure do not exceed 260° F
(127° C) and 10,000 psi (68.95 Mpa), respectively. Although smaller than previous CN
instruments, measurements obtained with the 2436 XA compare favorably with measurements
obtained from previous CN models.
The 2436 XA Compensated Neutron Instrument provides an indication of formation porosity
based on the interaction of neutrons emitted from a chemical source with the formation. The
2436 XA CN instrument has two detectors. These detectors are called short space (SS) and
long space (LS) based on their relative distance from the neutron source. An analog section
detects and amplifies pulses representing neutrons. The downhole controller counts these
pulses. The surface acquisition requests data via the telemetry from the CN instrument at
regular intervals. The CN tool answers by sending data in a formatted block called Subset 0,
which includes the stored counts and other auxiliary parameters. After each transmission, the
tool resets the counters and resumes accumulating counts. The tool is also capable of storing
tables containing calibration and revision-level data in non-volatile memory.

The primary calibration for the 2436 XA Compensated Neutron instruments is made in
the district calibration area using an environmental calibrator that accurately represents a
pre-defined porosity value.
The district environmental calibrator is matched to the Atlas Master Calibrator, located in
Houston. The Atlas Master Calibrator is referenced to the industry standard, which is the
API test pit at the University of Houston.
6.1.2
Primary Calibration
Responses of the long-space and short-space detectors to the environmental calibrator are
recorded during this calibration. The ratio of these responses is then calibrated to achieve
the porosity value that the calibrator represents.
6.1.3
Primary Verification
Primary verification is currently only done at the factory.
The 2436 XA Wellsite Verification Jig P/N 199847-000 (ice block) is required for
Primary verification. The porosity value the wellsite verifier represents is calculated

6.1.4
Internal Before Log Verification
The response of the 2436 XA electronics is verified against an internal oscillator when
internal before log verification is selected.
6.1.5
Internal After Log Verification
The response of the 2436 XA electronics is verified against an internal oscillator when
internal after log verification is selected. The internal after log verification should match
the internal before log verification, which indicates that the instrument has remained
stable during the logging operation.
6.1.6
Before Log Verification
This verification requires the use of the 2436 XA CN verification Jig (P/N 199847-000)
and is not normally done unless specifically requested by the customer. The instrument’s
response to the same verification standard used for primary calibration is obtained just
before running an instrument in the well. These results should match the primary
calibration within specified tolerances, and confirm that no change has occurred during
transportation to the wellsite. This before log verification establishes a stability reference
during logging. Refer to Section  21.0 for the before log verification procedure.
6.1.7
After Log Verification
This verification requires the use of the 2436 XA CN verification Jig (P/N 199847-000)
and is not normally done unless specifically requested by the customer. The instrument’s
response to the same calibration standard is again measured and recorded shortly after
completing logging. These results should match both the primary calibration and the
before log verification within specified tolerances, which indicates that the instrument has
remained stable during the logging operation. Refer to Section  21.0 for the after log
verification procedure."

A quick-look log quality check can be made by looking at the separation of the ZDEN and
CNC curves when plotted on compatible scales; e.g., ZDEN scaled 1.95 to 2.95 gm/cc and
CNC scaled 45 to -15 p.u. for limestone or ZDEN scaled 1.65 to 2.65 gm/cc with CNC scaled
60 to 0 (zero) p.u. for sandstone.
•
Limestone-scaled curves should overlay in clean water-bearing limestone in water-based
mud systems.
•
When a sandstone formation is presented on compatible limestone (1.95 to 2.95 gm/cc,
45 to -15 p.u.) scales, you should see a negative 6 to 8 p.u. separation (CNC < ZDEN) in
water-based mud systems.
•
The ZDEN and CNC curves show some separation (CNC porosity < ZDEN) in clean,
light-hydrocarbon zones. The magnitude of the separation depends on the hydrocarbon
types, the depth of invasion, and the mud filtrate density. The characteristics of the mud
filtrate differ in oil or water based mud systems.
If automatic caliper corrections are applied, CN log accuracy is affected in washed out or
rugose boreholes. Note that at 20 p.u., the caliper correction changes by one p.u. per inch.
Ensure that accurate values for borehole and formation salinities are used to apply salinity
corrections."

2436XA-CN-AMO,Instrument Operating Procedures - 13.5 LIMITATIONS AND ANOMALOUS RESPONSES,"Decentralization is critical in neutron logging. Log accuracy is degraded in rugose
boreholes and washouts where CN detectors are unable to conform to the borehole wall.
Caliper corrections applied in elliptical boreholes may be incorrect. The correction
algorithm assumes a circular borehole. The caliper usually measures the longest axis of
the borehole, whereas the CNC correction is better obtained using the borehole diameter
equivalent to the curvature at the CN tool’s point of contact.
Statistical variations are directly dependent on logging speed. Reading accuracy can
therefore be improved in zones of interest by reducing logging speed to as low as 10
ft/min (3.1 m/min).
Differences between repeat and main log compensated neutron curves are also caused by
erratic variations in logging speed and recorded depth due to sticking or to tracking of the
instrument on different sides of the borehole in heterogeneous formations."

The 2436 XA Compensated Neutron Instrument has two thermal-neutron detectors located at
different spacings from the Americium-Beryllium neutron source. The two detectors are
referred to as LS (long space) and SS (short space) during this discussion, based on their
relative position in the tool. Figure 1 is a simplified block diagram that shows the main
components of this instrument.

thermal neutrons. The LS and SS detectors, LS and SS preamplifier boards, neutron
controller board, ±5 V and ±12 V power supplies, high voltage power supply, and terminal
board are all located on or in the detector/electronics chassis assembly.
The LS and SS detectors require a positive high voltage bias (1,350 Vdc) that is supplied by
the high voltage power supply. When a neutron is detected, a pulse is generated. The pulses
from the LS and SS detectors are amplified and discriminated (separated from noise) in their
respective preamplifier boards. Digital counters in the neutron controller board accumulate
these pulses. The information in the neutron controller board is sent to the surface when the
telemetry requests data.

2436XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.0 ELECTRONICS CHASSIS ASSEMBLY .......................................................................3 2.1 DETECTORS........................................................................................................3,"ELECTRONICS CHASSIS ASSEMBLY
The Detector / Electronics Chassis Assembly includes the LS and SS detector, LS and SS
neutron moderator assemblies, LS and SS preamplifier boards, neutron controller board, ±5 V
and ±12 V power supplies, high voltage power supply, and the terminal board. 

DETECTORS
The LS and SS detectors are high-pressure Helium-3 (He3) proportional counters.
They are mounted along the tool axis and isolated from the 18-curie source by the
Boron Carbide-filled LS and SS moderator assemblies. The detectors consist of a
center electrode – anode – mounted inside a metal cylinder that is pressurized with
He3 gas. The bias voltage (1,350 Vdc) is applied to the anode, the external metal
cylinder (connected to common ground) acting as the cathode. A strong electric field
is then created between the anode and the cathode.
Thermal neutrons enter the detector and are captured by helium atoms, producing
protons and tritium particles.
Electrons are stripped away from these positively charged particles as they pass
through neutral helium atoms, creating primary ion pairs. The Electrons accelerate
rapidly toward the anode and the neutral helium atoms move toward the cathode in
this strong magnetic field. The electrons collide with other neutral helium atoms to
produce secondary ion pairs. This process repeats itself several times until an
avalanche of electrons at the anode produce a negative output pulse. A quenching
gas, typically CO2, is added to keep the discharge under control.
The output of the detector is a small electric charge, typically 3 to 4 pico-Coulombs.
After converting this charge to voltage and applying a large amount of amplification,
a pulse is obtained with a height that is characteristic of the detected neutron. Gamma
rays and thermal noise can also cause output pulses, but these pulses are smaller than
those caused by thermal neutrons. The difference allows the gamma ray and noise
pulses to be discriminated, allowing only neutron pulses to be counted.
The SS detector has an active dimension of 1.25 by 4 inches and is filled with four
atmospheres of He3. The LS detector is 2.25 by 8 inches and is filled to six
atmospheres.

2436XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.2 LS AND SS PREAMPLIFIER BOARDS ...............................................................4,"LS AND SS PREAMPLIFIER BOARDS
These two boards are functionally similar. Because of this functional similarity, only the
LS preamplifier board is discussed. Refer to LS Preamp Board schematic drawing
199125-100 and SS Preamp Board schematic drawing 199126-100 during the following
discussions.
Preamplifier, pulse shaping, and discriminator functions are incorporated into these
boards. Both the analog and discriminator functions are discussed.
2.2.1 Analog Circuit
The simplified schematic example (Figure 2) is a subset of schematic drawing 199125-
100. The R2-C1 network is configured as a filter to reduce noise in the high voltage
input. R3 is the load resistor of the detector and is kept large to avoid excessive loading
of the detector. Capacitor C9 de-couples the DC bias voltage. R2, R3, C1, and C9 are all
high-voltage, low-noise components. D2 and R10 protect the inputs of operational
amplifier U1, because of the presence of elevated potential. This stage is configured as a
charge-sensitive amplifier (very low input impedance to reduce stray capacitance effects)
with C2 as the storage capacitor and R4 as the bleed resistor. These two components (C2
and R4) are critical components in determining pulse shape.
Two conventional voltage amplifiers (U2 A and U2 B) that have a total gain of about 750
follow the U1 amplifier. The neutron peak of the resultant spectrum (main band seen on
an oscilloscope) should be 3 V at this point. Resistor R21 is adjusted to obtain this 3 V
output, which should remain constant over time. A rapid change indicates a problem.

2436 XA Focus Compensated Neutron – Circuit Descriptions
2.2.2 Discriminator Circuit
The discriminator circuit takes the pulses produced in the preamplifier section, corrects
the reference baseline, detects pulses larger than threshold, and shapes the output that is
sent to the controller board. Figure 3 is a simplified schematic that shows the primary
components and functions of the discriminator circuit.

polarity. Such unipolar pulses will produce a baseline shift when coupled through a
capacitor that is proportional to the average area of the pulse (i.e., more shift at higher
count rates). The problem is significant because of the high-count rates obtained with this
instrument (particularly in low porosity, small hole situations), and the relatively low
discriminator level. The circuit formed by C12, R5, R17, and D1 acts as a simple baseline
restorer, returning a value similar to the reference voltage. The reference voltage is
generated by U5.
The pulses present on R14 are compared in the U3 voltage comparator against a threshold

their amplitude above the threshold. Monostable U4 A is then added to conform to the
minimum timing requirements of the neutron controller board. R8 and C5 determine the
period. R12 is used only for protection.

2436XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.3 NEUTRON CONTROLLER BOARD.....................................................................6,"NEUTRON CONTROLLER BOARD
Refer to the Neutron Controller Board schematic drawing 199135-100 during the
following discussion. The main component in the controller board is U5, a micro-
controller integrating multiple peripheral functions including ROM, RAM, A/D
converter, timers, etc. U8 is a 16 MHz crystal-controlled oscillator that provides the
necessary clock signals. The main function of this controller is to accumulate the counts
from the two detectors and to send them to the telemetry when so instructed. This
information is formatted in a data block that also contains several auxiliary parameters.
The counts from both detectors are received via connectors J1 and J2 and routed to the
data selector U1. R1-D1 and R2-D2 provide protection. Controlled by commands from
the surface, U1 selects which pulses are counted, either detector data or pulses generated
by dividing the auxiliary oscillator U3 to verify proper tool function. The outputs of U1
are routed to two of the processor internal counters.
The communications between this tool and the telemetry are established using the Mode
2 protocol. The Manchester encoder-decoder U7 provides the necessary interface
functions supported by the clocks generated by U3 and divider U2. Transmission to the
tool bus is implemented with line driver U6, transformer T1, and associated hardware.
Reception is accomplished with transformer T2 and line receiver U9.
This tool has the capability to store tables containing calibration and hardware data. The
Flash EEPROM U10 is used for this purpose and is connected using a serial SPI bus to
the main processor.
Finally, the operational amplifiers in U11 condition analog signals that are then digitized
in the processor’s A/D converter for inclusion in the tool data block. The analog signals
monitored are:

The tool uses two standard power supply modules. One produces ±5 volts and is used by
the analog circuits and the processor board. The other module generates ±12 volts and is
used exclusively to power the high voltage power supply. This has been done to isolate
grounds because the detectors are mechanically and electrically connected to chassis,
which is also the signal return path. By using this module we avoid the galvanic
connection between the tool bus 28 V return line and chassis.

2436 XA Focus Compensated Neutron – Circuit Descriptions
Along with one of the supplies is an EMI filter module to drastically reduce interference
and interaction between supplies of other Focused Logging System instruments. These
self-contained, modular supplies mount on a heat-sinking channel and have additional
circuitry mounted on a PC board that is soldered directly to the pins of the supply. It is
this additional circuitry that will be the topic of discussion for this section.
Because the power supplies are modular, there is no repair of the unit. It either works or it
doesn’t. The only circuitry external to the module (U1) is some inhibiting control and
some additional output filtering.
2.4.1 Dual Power Supply
Instrument power first passes through an EMI filter module before being applied to any
DC to DC converter module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered +28 V. E2 is tied
to the return line of the EMI filter output. Pins 6, 7 and 8 are tied to chassis ground,
which is tied to cable armor. Three independent windings of a choke, L1, filter voltage
spikes on the output of the module. No provision is made for trimming the output
voltage. Additional output filtering is provided by capacitors C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7. See
the schematic (Figure 4) below.

2436 XA Focus Compensated Neutron – Circuit Descriptions
2.4.2 Power Control Circuit
Associated with the ±12 V-power supply module is an EMI filter module. The PC board
attached to this module performs several control functions. These control functions are
described below.
A +5 volt supply is generated for other chips on the PC board. The supply consists of a
single dropping resistor (R3) and reference Zener diode (D1) to establish the voltage.
This supply is connected to the output of the EMI filter module (U1). It is this +28 V EMI
filter output that connects to the input of other DC to DC converter modules within the
instrument. See the schematic (Figure 5) below.

circuit. The heart of the power control circuitry is a programmable microcontroller (U3).
Values for resistor R7 and capacitor C3 have been selected to give an operating
frequency of approximately 1 MHz. Supplied with +5 volts from the supply shown in
(1) A threshold voltage is established using chip U4. The voltage divider consisting of
R6 and R8 are chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for instrument power) is
present on R6, the reset chip removes the low on pin 7. The low on pin 7 removes the
reset from microcontroller U3, allowing it to do its job.

2436 XA Focus Compensated Neutron – Circuit Descriptions
(2) Jumper inputs to the microcontroller chip (U3) are set for different length delay
times. Delay times are established for different tools to limit the current demand
when the tool string is first powered up. Delay times, in milliseconds, and their
jumpers are shown in the table below.

(3) Output RA1 of U3 pin 18 is floating (open collector circuit) when power is first
applied to the microcontroller. Resistor R4 pulls the base of Q1 HIGH turning it ON.
This state applies a ground potential to all power supplies tied to the Q1 collector.
Diodes D2 – D4 form an OR function in the collector circuit, allowing control over
different power supplies. By tying the INHIBIT pin (active low) of each DC-to-DC
converter module within an instrument to one of these control terminals (E5, E6 or
E7), you can independently control its ON/OFF function. With Q1 initially turned
ON, no power supply module can turn ON. It is not until the time-out function is
completed by U3 that output RA1 can transition LOW, turning OFF Q1. With Q1
OFF, power supplies are allowed to turn ON because their INHIBIT is removed. As
the power supplies turn ON, their current demand is confined to that particular
instrument. Again, see the control circuit on page 10.

Refer to drawing 198384-100 for the complete schematic of the Power Controller board.
As an added feature of this circuit, Power Supply #2 or Power Supply #3 can be turned
OFF by an external source via opto-isolator U2. Terminal E8 is tied to a positive voltage.
Taking control terminal E9 or E10 LOW causes its respective switch to close. This
applies a ground potential to the INHIBIT input of the supply that is tied to its control
terminal, E6 or E7. This LOW turns OFF the respective power supply. Terminal E9
controls a power supply (P.S.2) connected to terminal E6, while E10 controls a supply
(P.S.3) connected to terminal E7. Thus, independent control is available if needed. Power
supplies connected to E5 are solely controlled by the timing function associated with the
operation of transistor Q1. Figure 7 is the schematic diagram of the opto-isolated power
supply control circuit.

HV POWER SUPPLY
The ±12 V Power Supply provides ±12 V to the inputs of the high voltage power supply
module. An external resistor adjusts the output value of the HV module to 1,350 Vdc. A
filter capacitor is installed across its output to reduce ripple noise. The resistor and
capacitor are mounted to terminal posts that are screwed directly into the chassis.

ELECTRICAL SAFETY PECAUTIONS
High voltage (1,350 Vdc) is present at various points on the compensated neutron
electronics chassis when the pressure housing is removed and power is applied to the
instrument. The following precautions apply.
•
Clear the area of all non-essential personnel and post the appropriate electrical
warning signs.
•
Never leave the tool unattended while power is on.
•
Turn off power to the tool if it not necessary to the task being performed.
•
High voltage is present at the following points on the electronics chassis when power
is on.
HV power supply and electrical components in the immediately vicinity
Pin 8 of the 10-pin connector at the top of the neutron controller PCB
Pin 6 (at neutron controller PCB) and pin 1 (at LS preamp PCB) of the LS
preamp cable
J2 on the LS preamp PCB
Pin 6 of the SS preamp cable at the controller PCB
High voltage is also present at the SS preamp PCB, LS detector, and the SS
detector. These points; however, are not typically exposed during normal
testing.
RADIATION SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
At times, both low-yield and high-yield neutron sources are used in the lab environment.
The following safety precautions apply.
Sources should only be handled by personnel that are trained in radiation safety.
Store sources in their correct storage container when not in use.
Clear the area of all personnel not directly involved in the installation, removal, or
other activities involving the nuclear source.
Post the appropriate warning signs and visual indicators when sources are out of their
storage containers or loaded in the tool.
Remember, radiation exposure is directly related to exposure time and distance from
the source. Use the correct source-handling tool and perform source handling
quickly, taking advantage of available shielding.

2436XA-CN-AMO,Test System Guide - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION
Laboratory functionality checks using the Lab PC Test System for the 2436 XA Compensated
Neutron instrument begins with resistance checks of wiring from the top connector pins to
chassis common. Once wiring is proven, other testing can begin.
Use the Lab PC Test System to check the operation of the circuitry. For details of how to
setup and use this test system, see the Manufacturing Checkout Procedure 130872-856.
Actual test steps to be performed on the 2436 XA are noted within the context of that
document (130872-856)."
2436XA-CN-AMO,Test System Guide - 2.0 RESISTANCE CHECKS,"RESISTANCE CHECKS
Before applying power and communicating to the instrument, checks should be performed to
ensure that there is no problem with the wiring. Using a Model 87 Fluke Multimeter or
equivalent, place the negative lead on the pin corresponding to Instrument Power − (pin 12)
and leave it in place for all the tests of this section. With the positive lead at the points
defined in the following table, ensure that the meter reading is within the tolerance indicated.
If all checks are good, proceed to Section  4.0, otherwise determine the fault associated with
any out-of-tolerance measurement and repair it before proceeding.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE          2446 XA WTS COMPENSATED NEUTRON 1.0 BRIEF DESCRIPTION
The 2446 XA Compensated Neutron instrument is a radiation logging device used to indicate formation
porosity in open or cased boreholes.  Two thermal neutron detectors are positioned at different spacings
from an 18-Curie, Americium 241 - Beryllium (AmBe) neutron source.  The near detector is referred to
as the ""short-spaced"" (SS) detector.  The far detector is referred to as the ""long-spaced"" (LS) detector.
The 2446 XA instrument is the latest in a long line of Compensated Neutron devices.  The 2446 XA
instrument is a conventional Compensated Neutron instrument and shares some components with the
older tools.  However, the 2446 XA is NOT a variation of the 2435/38 family.  The detectors,
corrections, response, calibration and software are all new.  The instrument offers many improvements
over the 2438 XA, including: increased long space count rate, decreased statistics, reduced borehole
salinity, more linear transform, etc.
The neutron source continuously emits fast neutrons. When the fast neutrons collide with the various
nuclei in the formation, they lose energy, slow to an epithermal energy level and then to a thermal
energy level. The proportional-counters used as detectors are designed to respond primarily to thermal
neutrons.  For well-logging applications, it is significant that hydrogen is one of the most effective
neutron thermalizers.  Therefore, a decreasing detector count indicates an increasing amount of
hydrogenous material between the source and the detectors.  This, in turn, indicates a higher formation
porosity.
The count rates from both the long-spaced detector and the short-spaced detector are processed in the
instrument and transmitted to the surface. Each signal passes through a three stage amplifier (Neutron
Pulse Processor board).
The surface computer calculates the short-spaced (SSN) count rate and the long-spaced (LSN) count
rate.  A SSN/LSN ratio is derived and used to compute the apparent limestone porosity curve (CN).
Corrections are also applied to the ratio to compute CNC.  The corrections include:  other lithologies,
borehole size and salinity, stand-off, pressure, temperature, etc.
Both detectors and the main electronic components are placed inside a vacuum flask to protect them
from excessive temperatures.

GENERAL DATA ACQUISITION DESCRIPTION    2446 XA WTS COMPENSATED NEUTRON
SAMPLED DATA
Long spaced and short spaced count rates are acquired and recorded as curves named LSN and SSN,
respectively.  Counts are accumulated downhole, and transmitted to the surface using digital telemetry.
CN CURVES
 SSN
Short Spaced Counts from CN
 LSN
Long Spaced Counts from CN
LSN and SSN are typically acquired at 4 samples/foot; 1 or 2 samples/decimeter.  This is a finer
resolution than the vertical bed resolution of the instrument.
DEADTIME CORRECTION
Radiation detectors are subject to a phenomenon referred to as ""deadtime"".  Deadtime may be defined
simply as the amount of time that must elapse before another event can be detected.  Any events that
occur during the deadtime of a detector are missed.
The count rates of the 2446 XA CN instrument are dead time corrected.  The current values used for
dead time correction are 20 microseconds for the short space detector and 24 microseconds for the long
space detector.  Dead time correction is applied using the following formula:
CR   = CR
 /(1-CR
t)
dtc
raw

where CR
 is the count rate for either the SS or LS detector in counts per second (cps),  is the

GENERAL DATA ACQUISITION DESCRIPTION    2446 XA WTS COMPENSATED NEUTRON
Previous versions of Western Atlas CN instruments typically had a ""CHI SMOOTH"" filter applied to
the CN curve.  This filtering technique is not allowed with the 2446 XA CN instrument.  The filtering
technique used with the 2446 XA accomplishes two things.  The first is to average the SSN count rate
over the number of levels corresponding to 1 foot (or 0.4 meters) (""box car type filter"") to
approximately match the vertical resolution of the two detectors.  The number of levels averaged is
dependent on the sample rate.  After this, the normal Atlas 11 point filter is applied to both the SSN and
LSN.  The standard filter weights are available (0=no filtering, 1=normal filtering, 2=weak filtering,
and 3=strong filter).  In all cases, SSN and LSN are recorded to tape as unfiltered curves.
Filter weight is selected by the service table.  Service tables used for 2438 XA WTS CN instruments
can be used for the 2446 XA instrument with the addition of one curve, ""CNRT"".  The curve CNRT
must be added as a computed curve after the sampled curves and before CN.

CALIBRATION TAIL          2446 XA WTS COMPENSATED NEUTRON
INTRODUCTION
The primary calibration for Compensated Neutron (CN) instruments is made in the district calibration
area using a 2437 XB CN calibrator to accurately represent a pre-defined porosity value.
The district calibrator is matched to the Atlas Master Calibrator, located in Houston, which is
referenced to the industry standard, the API test pit at the University of Houston.
PRIMARY CALIBRATION
During the calibration, the response of the long spaced and short spaced detectors to the 2437 XB 
calibrator are recorded.  The ratio of these responses is then calibrated to achieve the porosity value that
the calibrator represents.
PRIMARY VERIFICATION
After an instrument has been calibrated, its response to a field verification standard (either an ""ice
block"" or a single-point verification jig) is recorded (again in the district calibration area) and the
porosity value the block or jig represents is calculated using the calibration data just obtained.  This
field verification standard will go with the instrument for subsequent verifications.
BEFORE LOG VERIFICATION
Shortly before running an instrument in the well, its response to the field verification standard is
obtained.  These results should match the Primary Verification within specified tolerances, and confirm
that no change has occurred during transportation to the wellsite.  This establishes a reference for
stability during logging.
AFTER LOG VERIFICATION
Shortly after completing logging, the instrument's response to the field verification standard is again
measured and recorded.  These results should match both the Primary Verification and the Before Log
Verification within specified tolerances, indicating that the instrument has remained stable during the
logging operation.

1.0 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
(Ref. Dwg C150145-000)
The 2446 XA Compensated Neutron Instrument has two thermal-neutron detectors located at
different spacings from an Americium-Beryllium chemical neutron source.  For this discussion the
detectors will be referred to as SS (short spaced) and LS (long spaced), based on their relative
position in the tool.  The simplified block diagram (below) describes the main components of this
instrument.
Both detectors are Helium-3 ( He) proportional counters, which are sensitive primarily to thermal
3
neutrons.  The detectors, the analog and digital processing boards and the high voltage regulator
are located inside a thermal flask.  These neutron detectors require a positive high voltage bias
(+1150 Vdc), which is provided by a high voltage power supply module located in the upper
chassis.  When a neutron is detected, a pulse is generated.  The pulses for both the LS and SS
channels are amplified and discriminated (separated from noise) in the analog board.  Digital
counters in the processor board accumulate these pulses.  When the telemetry requests the data, the
information is sent to the surface via the WTS bus.
On the chassis outside the flask, an I/O board provides the interface between the processor and the
external WTS bus.  A power supply converts the AC power on the WTS bus to low voltage used in
the tool and also feeds the high voltage module with 24 volts DC."

2446XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 2.1 DETECTORS,"The LS and SS detectors are high pressure ( He) proportional counters.  They are mounted on
3
the tool axis, and surrounded by different materials selected for their neutron related
properties.  The detectors themselves consist of a center electrode -- the anode -- mounted
inside a metal cylinder is pressurized with helium  gas.  The bias voltage (+1150 VDC) is
3
applied to the anode, with the metallic external cylinder (connected to common ground) acting
as a cathode.  A strong electric field is then created between the anode and cathode.
Thermal neutrons enter the detector and are captured by helium atoms, producing protons and
tritium particles.  As these positively charged particles pass neutral helium atoms, electrons
are stripped away creating primary ion pairs.  In the strong electric field, the electrons
accelerate rapidly toward the anode, and the positive helium atoms move to the cathode.  The
electrons collide with other neutral helium atoms to produce secondary ion pairs.  This
process repeats itself several times until an avalanche of electrons at the anode produces a
negative output pulse.  A quenching gas, typically CO , is added to keep the discharge under
2
control.
The output of the detector is a small electric charge, about 3 or 4 pico-Coulombs.  After
converting this charge to voltage and applying a large amount of amplification, a pulse is
obtained with a height characteristic of a detected neutron.  Although output pulses can also
be caused by gamma rays and thermal noise, that type of pulse is smaller than those caused by
thermal neutrons.  This difference allows the gamma ray pulses to be discriminated so that
only neutron pulses are counted.
The SS detector has an active dimension of 1 by 3 inches and is filled with 4 atmospheres of
He.  The LS detector is 1.75 by 8 inches long and filled to 6 atmospheres of pressure."

DISCRIMINATOR AND BIAS CIRCUITS
The U1 amplifier is followed by two conventional voltage amplifiers with a total gain of about
1800 times.  At this point the neutron peak of the resultant spectrum (main band seen in an
adequate analog oscilloscope) should be 3 V.  Resistor R10 is selected to obtain this output,
which should remain constant over time.  A rapid change will indicate a need for
troubleshooting and repair.
Because this tool does not have a split power supply, the op-amps are referenced to a voltage
(V ) that is about half the supply voltage.  Capacitor C5 helps keep noise levels low.

2.3 NEUTRON PULSE PROCESSOR BOARD - Discriminator Circuit
(Ref. Dwg. B142258-100)
The discriminator circuit takes the pulses produced in the preamplifier section, corrects the
reference base line, detects any pulse larger than a threshold, and shapes the output that is
then sent to the controller board.  The simplified circuit shown below is used to descibe
primary components and functions."

CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS          2446 XA WTS COMPENSATED NEUTRON
The pulses produced in the preamplifier section (nominal 3 V peak) are of a single polarity.
Such unipolar pulses will produce a shift in the base line when coupled through a capacitor
that is proportional to the average area of the pulses, i.e. more shift at higher count rates.
This problem is significant because of the high count rates obtained with this instrument
(particularly in low-porosity, small-hole situations), and the relatively low discriminator level.
The circuit formed by C16, R21, R22, D3, and D4 acts as a simple base line restorer,
returning a value similar to the reference voltage V .  This V  voltage is generated by Zener
ref
ref
diode Z1 and filtered by C28.
The pulses present on R28 are compared in the U3 voltage comparator against a threshold
voltage (V
) set by the R40-R43 voltage divider, which divides the voltage regulated by the
disc
reference diode Z2 (very stable).  The R29-R27 net forms a positive feedback loop to avoid
multiple triggering.  The digital pulses generated on R30 are of different length, depending on
their amplitude above the threshold.  Monostable U4 is then added to conform with the
minimum timing requirements of the controller board microcontroller, with R31-C23
determining the period, and R32 used only for protection.  Note than in this instrument there
is no provision for direct line transmission, so scalers are not used.
The power supply section is shown in the lower section of the schematic.  It is
straightforward, with the only distinction being that two different grounds are shown,
connected by a jumper.  The digital circuits put high currents on the ground return path, and
their ground (DGND) was kept separated from the analog ground (GND) used in the high gain
preamplifiers to avoid noise problems."
2446XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 2.4 CONTROLLER BOARD,"(Ref. Dwg. B150118-100)
The operation of the board is controlled by microcontroller IC5.  All command executions,
data acquisitions, and data transmissions are controlled by IC5.  The controller can be
operated at 8 or 16 MHz.  This tool uses the 8 MHz jumper.  The power up reset is generated
by IC3 using timing components R1, C10, and R2, C11.  Resistors R5 and R6 protect IC3.  In
this tool, the controller board provides the following 5 functions:
1)
WTS T2 MODE COMMUNICATIONS (in conjunction with the I/O board)
Command Reception
Unipolar Data Input (UDI Pin 5 J1) are the Manchester encoded commands from the
instrument bus.  The commands for all tools in the string will be present.  This signal is
buffered by one gate of IC1 and then input to IC4 pin 8 to be decoded.  The decoded
command (IC4 Pin 4) is sent to IC5 to be processed.  If the command is not for the 2446, the
decoding process is halted; and IC4 is reset to accept the next command.  If the command is
for the 2446, the decoding process continues to completion.  IC5 verifies that this is a valid
command word by testing the level of Command/Data Sync (IC4 pin 10) and by looking for a
Valid word (IC4 pin 1).  The reception process is interrupt driven.  The interrupt is generated
by nanding Take data (IC4 pin 3) and the decoder shift clock (IC4 pin 9) using one gate of
IC7.  The decoder clock (IC4 pin 5) is a 500 KHz square wave from IC6."

CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS          2446 XA WTS COMPENSATED NEUTRON
Data Transmission
Transmission begins when encoder enable (IC4 pin 19) is set.  The data to be transmitted is
presented on serial data input (IC4 pin 18).  The data is then encoded in bipolar Manchester
format, buffered by two gates of IC1, and put on pins 3 and 4 of J1.  The transmission process
is interrupt driven.  The interrupt is generated by nanding shift data (IC4 pin 21) and the
encoder shift clock (IC4 pin 2).  The encoder clock (IC4 pin 23) is a 250 khz square wave
from IC6.
2)
VOLTAGE MONITORS -
Monitor flask temperature and the 24 VDC instrument
supply.
Flask Temperature
The +5 (J1 pin 13) and Ground (J1 pin 12) supply the power for a temperature sensor
mounted on the chassis.  A voltage of 10 mV per degree F is produced by the sensor.  This
voltage is connected to J1 pin 10.  The voltage is then applied to one input (IC2 pin 2) of the
A/D converter.
24 VDC Power Supply
The 24 VDC power supply used by the flask electronics is connected to J1 pin 11.  The
voltage is divided by 10 using R3 and R4.  The attenuated voltage is applied to the second
input (IC2 pin 3) of the A/D converter.  This results in a full-scale input voltage of +50 VDC
at J1 pin 11.
3)
FREQUENCY COUNTERS - Count pulses from the long and short space detectors
The long-space pulses are applied to J1 Pin 2, buffered by one gate of IC1, and input to IC5
pin 15.  The short-space pulses are applied to J1 pin 1, buffered by one gate of IC1, and input
to IC5 on pin 14.  The pulses from both channels are counted up to a maximum of 65,535.
The counters are read, buffered using IC5 internal RAM, and reset when data is requested
from the tool.

POWER SUPPLY"
2446XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.1 POWER SUPPLY,"This assembly obtains AC power from the instrument bus and converts it into DC power for
the tool.  The outputs are +5 VDC for the logic circuit, +24 VDC for the analog circuits,
and +1150 VDC (the high voltage necessary for detector operation).
The primary winding of the power transformer is connected to conductors 1 and 4 of the WTS
instrument bus.  These two conductors provide AC power at a nominal voltage of 180 VAC
RMS.  There are three secondary windings.  The first winding is rectified by bridge D6 and
filtered by capacitor C6.  The unregulated voltage on C6 is then regulated to +5 VDC by
series voltage regulator IC1 and filtered by C5.  Diode D1 protects IC1 against reverse
voltage on power down conditions.
The output from the second winding is rectified by D5 and filtered by C3.  This unregulated
voltage is then regulated by parallel regulator R2-D3 to 24 VDC with C4 as a filter.  This
+24 volt output is used to power the analog circuits of the tool."
2446XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.2 HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY,"The circuit connected to the third winding (D4, C1, R1, D2, and C2) follows the previous
description, but this 24 VDC supply is used to power the high voltage supply.  This module
produces a high voltage output controlled by the value of resistor R3.  The output is filtered
by the pi-filter comprised of C8, R4, and C7.  Resistor R6 functions as a voltage bleeder
resistor.  The voltage on C8 (nominal 1350 VDC) is the output regulated voltage of the high
voltage supply.  The voltage on C7 (nominal 1150 VDC) is determined by a parallel corona
regulator in the flask assembly.  The regulating current for the regulator in the flask assembly
is set by the value of R4."
2446XA-CN-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.3 I/O BOARD (REFER TO DWG B150116-100),"This board is the interface between the WTS instrument bus and the tool electronics.  The
WTS bus and the circuit design of this board are the company standard (059448-926).  The
only additional components are for decoupling capacitors and two gates for multiple T5 mode
transmissions.  The schematic indicates three separate circuits providing the following
functions:
1.
M2 Command Reception (T2)
2.
M2 Data Transmission (T2)
3.
M5 Data Transmission (T5)
M2 Command Reception
This section converts Manchester encoded signals on the WTS instrument bus (the command
channel) into a ground-referenced, Manchester encoded, unipolar, serial data stream that can
be analyzed by the tool.  The tool will analyze this data stream to determine if a valid tool
specific command has been received.  The WTS command bus is input to the board on P1 pin
18 and 19.  The signal is transformer coupled to a resistive network for termination and
voltage biasing.  The signal across R6, R7, and R8 is applied to a differential input of IC3
(Pin 1 and 3).  With no signal present, IC3 Pin 1 will be slightly more positive than IC3 pin 3
causing the output of IC3 (pin 6) to be low.  When a signal is present on the command bus,
the output of IC3 (pin 6) should produce pulses of approximately 5 volts.
M2 Data Transmission
This section puts Manchester encoded data from the tool onto the WTS instrument bus (mode
2 channel).  A biphase Manchester encoded signal produced by the tool is applied to pins 5
and 4 of P1.  This signal causes IC2 to alternately draw current through one half of the
primary winding in output transformer T102.  The resistors and diodes in each driver channel
control current flow.  The signal produced at the secondary is connected to the WTS
instrument bus (mode 2 channel) through pins 1 and 20 of P1."

4. DISCRIMINATOR ADJUSTMENT


Note
The checkout procedures in Sections 3.0 through 3.5  should be
made before adjusting the discriminator.

1.
Disassemble the instrument.  Refer to Section 955.
2.
Place the electronics assembly in a calibration cradle.
3.
Connect a test system to the electronics assembly.
4.
Apply 180 Vac to the electronics.  Current should be 60 ± 6 mA.



Note
Discriminator adjustments should not be necessary.  The gain and
discriminator settings influence instrument dead time.  Dead time
is fixed in software; therefore, the gain and discriminator levels
should be constant.  If a discriminator curve is required for trouble
shooting purposes, R43 must be removed and a decade box
connected in its place.

(Ref. Dwgs. A142258-000 and C142258-100)

1.
Connect a DVM between R40 and the decade box in R43's place on the neutron
pulse processor board.
2.
Position the A97712 source over the SS detector.
3.
Use a counter to take a 100-second count (minimum).  Record the count rate on a
discriminator adjustment form like the one shown on following page.
4.
Increase the trigger level in 200 mV increments, by adjusting the decade box.
5.
Record the count rate at each Voltage setting.
6.
Continue until only a few pulses are detected.

5. FINAL CHECK
This test reveals the relative sensitivity of both detectors and verifies that there is no
cross talk between the SS and LS channels.

1.
Reassemble the tool and position it a minimum of 2' above ground level, using a
tool dolly or sawhorses.
2.
Connect a test system and apply 180 Vac to the instrument.
3.
Place the A97712 lab source so that it is centered at a point 8 inches from the
bottom of the housing.  This is the approximate center of activity of the SS detector.
4.
Take a 200-second reading and record the results for both detectors.

6. DETECTOR CHECKOUT  (Optional)
(Ref. Dwgs. A142258-000 and C142258-100)

Perform this task if a problem is suspected in the 2446 XA detectors.  The following
procedure should indicate if the 3 He detector operating position has shifted.

1.
Disconnect the high-Voltage wire from terminal T1 (HV) on the neutron pulse
processor board.
2.
Connect an adjustable high-Voltage power supply to the HV terminal on the neutron
pulse processor board.
3.
Apply 180 Vac to the electronics on conductors 1 and 4.
4.
Place the neutron check source over the detector in question.
5.
Adjust the high-Voltage power supply down from 1100 Volts until relatively few
counts are noticed at the test system.
6.
Set the high-Voltage power supply to the next higher 25 Volt increment (i.e. 25, 50,
75, or 100).
7.
Take a 100 second reading (both high Voltage and counts) at this Voltage.
8.
Record this reading (both high Voltage and counts).
9.
Turn the high-Voltage supply up 25 Volts.
10.
Repeat steps 6-9 until a large change in count rate is observed (from the rate in the
previous Voltage step).

11.
Plot the data as shown in Figure 953-11.  Label the point at which the count rate
begins to level off (relatively) with increasing voltage ""Point A"".  Label the point at
which the count rate begins to change in large increments with each incremental
voltage increase ""Point B"". Point C lies between Point A and Point B.
12.
Note the position of the 1150 Volt operating point versus the curve resulting from the
plot.
13.
The correct position for the 1150 Volt point on the graph is the general range of the C
position.
14.
If the 1150 Volt point is to the left of point A on the graph, reject the tube.
15.
If the 1150 Volt point is to the right of point B on the graph, reject the tube.
16.
Turn off power to the electronics, both AC and high-Voltage supplies.
17.
Reconnect the high-Voltage wire to the neutron pulse processor board."

2809XA-NT-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.0 OVERVIEW....................................................................................................................3,"OVERVIEW
Refer to the block diagram in Figure 1. The 2809 XA Focus Noise/Temperature instrument is
part of the Focus instrument string. The Focus Noise/Temperature instrument detects gas
entry in air filled boreholes using acoustic and temperature measurements. The acoustic
portion of the tool consists of two transducer arrays spaced approximately 42-inches apart.
These transducer arrays along with the electronics are capable of detecting gas entry in the 20
kHz to 60 kHz ultrasonic range. In addition, the acoustic portion is capable of detecting gas
entry in fluid filled boreholes in the 100 Hz to 20 kHz range. The temperature portion of the
instrument consists of four RTD elements, each 90˚ from the next and connected serially to
provide greater circumferential sensitivity. The four RTDs are located near the bottom of the
instrument."
2809XA-NT-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.1 ELECTRONICS ....................................................................................................3,"ELECTRONICS
The Focus Noise/Temperature electronics chassis is located between the two acoustic
transducer arrays. The Focus Noise/Temperature electronics is MIB compatible and
simultaneously acquires two acoustic waveforms from the two transducer arrays and one
temperature measurement from the four RTDs. The electronics are responsible for
selecting mode of acquisition, gain control, down-hole digitization, digital DSP filtering
as required, and FFT of waveform data as required. The chassis is extruded aluminum,
which is standard for Focus instruments.
The electronics main components are:
•

2809XA-NT-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.0 DC POWER SUPPLIES.................................................................................................5,"DC POWER SUPPLIES
The 2809 XA Noise / Temperature Electronics have two power supplies mounted on the electronics
backbone. Along with one of the supplies is an EMI filter module to drastically reduce interference
and interaction between supplies of other Focused Logging System instruments. These self-contained,
modular supplies mount on a heat-sinking channel and have additional circuitry mounted on a PC
board that is soldered directly to the pins of the supply. It is this additional circuitry that will be the
topic of discussion for this section.
Because the power supplies are modular, there is no repair of the unit. It either works or it doesn’t.
The only circuitry external to the module (U1) is some inhibiting control and some additional output
filtering."
2809XA-NT-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.1 SINGLE POWER SUPPLY...................................................................................5,"SINGLE POWER SUPPLY
See the schematic (Figure 2) below for a typical configuration of these external
components for a single output power module.


The E7 terminal shown on the INHIBIT pin of U1 is used to delay the output for a
specific time after power is applied. Combinations of J1 through J4 shorted on the power
control PC board provide the various delays. Refer to the delay table located in the power
control circuit section for the actual settings for a given tool. The control circuit for
inhibit is located on the power control PC board, above the EMI filter.
Instrument power is defined as +28 V for the tool string. This cablehead voltage first
passes through an EMI filter module before being applied to a DC-to-DC converter
module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered +28 V. E2 is tied to the return line of
the EMI filter output. Pins 6, 7 and 8 are tied to chassis ground which, in turn, is tied to
cable armor. Two independent windings of choke, L1 filter voltage spikes on the output
of the converter module. Provision is made at J1 for trimming the output voltage under
expected loads. In most cases, this provision is left unused. Additional output filtering is
provided by capacitors C3, C4 and C5.

2809XA-NT-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.2 DUAL POWER SUPPLY ......................................................................................6,"DUAL POWER SUPPLY
In the case where a power supply module generates an output of dual polarity, the
associated circuitry is slightly modified. See the schematic (Figure 3) below.

The E9 terminal shown on the INHIBIT pin of U1 delays the output for a specific time
after power is applied. Combinations of J1 through J4 shorted on the power control PC
board provide the various delays. Refer to the delay table located in the power control
circuit section for the actual settings for a given tool. The control circuit for inhibit is
located on the power control PC board, above the EMI filter.
Again, instrument power first passes through an EMI filter module before being applied
to any DC-to-DC converter module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered +28 V.
Terminal E2 is tied to the return line of the EMI filter output. Pins 6, 7 and 8 are tied to
chassis ground, which is tied to cable armor. Three independent windings of choke L1
filter voltage spikes on the output of the module. No provision is made for trimming the
output voltage. Additional output filtering is provided by capacitors C3, C4, C5, C6 and
C7.

2809 XA Focus Noise / Temperature Instrument – Circuit Descriptions

Power Control Circuit: An EMI filter module is associated with at least one of the
DC-to-DC power supply modules. The PC board attached to this module performs
several control functions. These control functions are described below.
A +5 volt supply is generated for other chips on the PC board. The supply consists of a
single dropping resistor (R3) and reference Zener diode (D1) to establish the voltage.
This supply is connected to the output of the EMI filter module (U1). It is this +28 V EMI
filter output that connects to the input of other DC-to-DC converter modules within the
instrument. See the schematic (Figure 4) below.


Refer to schematic diagram of the Power Supply Control circuit on page 9. The heart of
the power control circuitry is a programmable microcontroller (U3). Values for resistor
R7 and capacitor C3 have been selected to give an operating frequency of approximately
1 MHz. Supplied with +5 volts from the supply of Figure 4, the microcontroller acts as a
timer to control the turn-on time of anything tied to its output. There are basically three
functions concerning this circuit. They are (1) a voltage threshold, (2) the delay circuit
and (3) the control/inhibit circuit.
(1)
A threshold voltage is established using chip U4. The voltage divider consisting of
R6 and R8 are chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for instrument power) is
present on R6, the reset chip removes the LOW on pin 7 which in turn removes the
reset from microcontroller U3, allowing it to do its job.

Jumper inputs to the microcontroller chip U3 set different length delay times.
Delay times are established for different tools to limit the current demand when the

Output RA1 of U3 pin 18 is floating (open collector circuit)when power is first
applied to the microcontroller. Resistor R4 pulls the base of Q1 HIGH turning it
ON. This state applies a ground potential to all power supplies tied to the Q1
collector. Diodes D2 – D4 form an OR function in the collector circuit that allows
control over different power supplies. By tying the INHIBIT pin (active low) of
each DC-to-DC converter module within an instrument to one of these control
terminals (E5, E6 or E7), you can independently control its ON/OFF function.
With Q1 initially turned ON, no power supply module can turn ON. It is not until
the time-out function is completed by U3 that output RA1 can transition LOW,
turning OFF Q1. With Q1 turned OFF, power supplies are allowed to turn ON
because their INHIBIT is removed. As the power supplies turn ON, their current
demand is confined to that particular instrument. Again, see the control circuit
(Figure 5) on page 9.

Refer to drawing 198384-100 for the complete schematic of the Power Controller board.
As an added feature of this circuit, Power Supply #2 or Power Supply #3 can be turned
OFF by an external source via opto-isolator U2. Terminal E8 is tied to a positive voltage.
Taking control terminal E9 or E10 LOW causes its respective switch to close. This
applies a ground potential to the INHIBIT input of the supply that is tied to its control
terminal, E6 or E7. This LOW turns OFF the respective power supply. Terminal E9
controls a power supply (P.S.2) connected to terminal E6, while E10 controls a supply
(P.S.3) connected to terminal E7. Thus, independent control is available if needed. Power
supplies connected to E5 are solely controlled by the timing function associated with the
operation of transistor Q1. See the schematic (Figure 6) below.



DATA ACQUISITION / RECEIVER BOARD
The Data Acquisition Board (DAQ) board is mainly responsible for digitizing and processing
the receiver and RTD signals, and communicating to the surface system via the instrument
bus. The DAQ board, on command from the surface system, can send data on Mode 5 or
Mode 7. The DAQ board obtains power from the 3.3 V digital and ±5 V analog power
supplies. Additionally, the 3.3 V digital is boosted to 5 V digital for the modal drivers.

Refer sheet 1 of schematic drawing A3000343 SCH and Figure 7 during this discussion.
The 2809 XA has two receiver crystals (Rx1 and Rx2) connected to the DAQ boards
instrumentation amplifiers U29 and U33 as differential inputs. The gain of the
instrumentation amplifier is given by G = (50500/RG) +1. Therefore, with a gain resistor
value of 10.0k-Ω, the gain of the instrumentation amplifier circuit is approximately 15.6
dB. This gain value was selected to optimize frequency response while providing high
common mode rejection. These two analog signals are multiplexed via U32. The
multiplexers output is controlled by M1 and M2, which are set by firmware via flag 10
(M1) and flag 11 (M2) on the DSP (U15). There are four possible modes selected by M1
and M2. Table 1 shows the M1 and M2 settings for each particular mode.

Noise mode passes Rx1 and Rx2 receiver signals through the multiplexers to the two
analog channels.
3.2.2
Test Signal
Refer to sheets 1 and 4 of schematic drawing A3000343 SCH during this discussion. The
test signal (TS) is a single step function delayed 1.0 ms after the rising edge of the test
fire pulse (TP53). The test signal and the test fire pulse are generated in the FPGA. The
test signal is level shifted from 3 volts to 5 volts by U36, divided down by R72 and R73,
and then passed through multiplexer U5 to both analog channels when M2 is high and
M1 is low. M2 and M1 are set in the firmware during initialization and the test signal is
used to verify the gain and band-pass filter response of the analog stages.
3.2.3
Ground Signal
The ground signal input to the multiplexer is provided so that the DC offset in the last
band-pass filter and gain stages can be software corrected on each transmitter firing when
needed.
3.2.4
Analog Gain/Filter
Referring to Channel One on A3000343 SCH. The noise transducer signals are amplified
by 100 V/V at 40kHz by U4 and U1. After the multiplexer U5, the signal is
amplified/attenuated by U39. The signal is than band-pass filtered at 40 kHz with a gain
of 6.5 V/V by the four stages of U9. The signal is then amplified/attenuated by U11. The
combined gain/attenuation of U39 and U11 is given in Table 2. The signal is then
amplified by 2 V/V above 100 Hz by U12.

2809XA-NT-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.4 ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER................................................................15,"ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER
The DAQ board uses two 16-bit charge redistribution SAR A/D’s (U1 and U2) to digitize
signals from both analog channels. Both A/Ds start sampling simultaneously at the
leading edge of a sync pulse (i.e. the Sync Pulse or the Test Sync Pulse) and sample at the
same rate. Refer to Figure 9 for timing. The A/D’s can be set to digitize at 4 µs, 8 µs, 16
µs, 24 µs, or 72 µs sampling rates. The convert signal that initiates sampling is generated
from the Field-Programmable Gate Array (U20) at the specified sampling rate. The Field-
Programmable Gate Array generates a discontinuous serial clock exactly 2-µs after the
convert signal to clock out the digitized data.
As mentioned earlier, each A/D services an analog channel. Each A/D shifts data to a
serial channel of the Digital Signal Processor (U15). A/D channel 1 is connected to one
port of the Digital Signal Processor’s serial channel 0. Similarly, A/D channel 2 is wired
to the other port of the Digital Signal Processor’s serial channel 0.
The A/D is setup as a Slave Serial Device on the DAQ board. As the read and chip-select
signals on the A/Ds are made permanently active, the serial clock causes the data to
serially shift out of the A/Ds. The serial clock becomes inactive after all 16 bits are
shifted out. The serial clock frequency is 12 MHz.
The data shifted out is in 2s complement format, with the most significant bit first.



CLOCK AND RESET LOGIC
The DAQ board has one 24 MHz master clock (U14). The Digital Signal Processor (U15)
and the Field-Programmable Gate Array (U20) use this 24-MHz clock for all their timing
needs.
The DAQ board has an additional 10-MHz clock that is used by the RTD A/D (U17).
The DAQ board is held in reset when the voltage-monitoring pin MR/ on reset chip U26
is less than or equal to 2.96 V. Pressing the S1 button can also reset the board.

DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR
The DAQ board’s Digital Signal Processor (DSP) is responsible for receiving and
responding to surface commands. Together with the Field-Programmable Gate Array, the
DSP controls the entire noise / temperature tool.
The DSP firmware is stored in a flash memory on the DAQ board. At power up the DSP
loads the program from this flash memory and then runs the program in its internal
program memory. Some internal memory and two external RAMs are used for data
memory space.
Some of the DSP sections are described in detail below.
Clock: The DSP is provided with a 24-MHz clock that translates internally to a 42-MHz
instruction rate. Please refer to the data-sheet for timing diagrams and timing delays. For
timing calculation use the following value of the symbol DT (de-rating).
•
DT = (tCK-33.3)/32
•
CLKIN = 24 MHz
•
tCK = 1/24 MHz in ns
•
DT = (41.67-33.3)/32 = 0.26

Clock Generation
Refer to Figure 10 during this discussion.
U20 divides the 24-MHz clock signal (CLKIN) by two to produce a 12-MHz clock,
which all other clocks are derived from. U20 then divides the 12-MHz clock signal by 12,
24, 48, and 64 to provide:
1. A 12 MHz continuous serial clock (SCLK) for U15 synchronous serial received data
from the A/D’s.
2. A 12 MHz discontinuous serial clock (DSCLK) for A/D’s synchronous serial
transmission of data to the DSP (U15).
3. A 500-kHz clock for Mode 2 transmitter logic (U20 internal).
4. A 250-kHz clock signal for the Mode 2 receiver logic (U20 internal).
5. A 187.5-kHz clock for U20 transmitter logic (Mode 5 and Mode 7).
6. A 1-MHz clock signal for the temperature sensor (U22).
7. In addition, the 250-kHz clock is divided by 2 to provide a 125 kHz (8 µs) A/D
sample clock and TCLK0 from the DSP (U15) is routed into and out of the FPGA to
provide the DAC transmit clock.

WTS Interface (Mode 2, Mode 5, and Mode 7)
Refer to Figure 11 during this discussion.
Mode 2 Receive Command / Data: Mode 2 commands / data are sent from the surface
and transformer-coupled via T1 on the DAQ board. U19 converts the line signals to TTL
levels. The equivalent of a 6408 Harris Manchester Encoder / Decoder has been
incorporated into Actel (U20). U20 decodes this Manchester protocol data (MD2 UDI)
and converts the serial data to parallel data. U20 checks the received data for a universal
address 00 or tool address 04. If either address is received, interrupt MD2 RXIRQ/
interrupts the DSP (U15) on IRQ1/ and the command is transferred to a buffer.
MD2 RXIRQ/ is reset by the FPGA after the command is read by the DSP. If data follows
the WTS command, interrupt MD2 RXIRQ/ interrupts the DSP and the data is transferred
to a buffer. MD2 RXIRQ is reset by the FPGA after each data word is read.
Mode 2 Transmit Data: On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit data via
Mode 2 (such as tool tables), the DSP enables interrupt IRQ0/ (MD2 TXIRQ) and sends
the requested data via the 16-bit data bus to the FPGA’s (U20) Mode 2 encoder logic.
U20 converts the data from parallel to serial format and the U20 6408 Harris Manchester
equivalent encoder, encodes MD2 BZO/ data and MD2 BOO/ data. Data is sent to line
driver (U21), and then is transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T2. Whenever the U20
data buffer is empty, U20 generates an interrupt (MD2 TXIRQ) that interrupts the DSP
and the DSP sends the next word.
Mode 5 and Mode 7 Transmit Data: The equivalent of two 6409 Harris Manchesters
have been incorporated into the FPGA (U20) for Mode 5 and Mode 7 data transmission.
Mode 5 or Mode 7 data is transmitted using interrupt IRQ2/ (MD5 IRQ/). MD57 SW (See
to the MAP command sent from the surface acquisition system.
Mode 5 Transmit Data: On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit Mode 5
data the DSP enables interrupt MD5 IRQ/ and writes the first word of the requested data
via the 16-bit data bus to the FPGA’s (U20) Mode 5 encoder logic. The data is converted
from parallel to serial format by U20. The U20 6409 Harris Manchester equivalent
encoder receives serial data and the encoded data (M5 BZO/ and M5 BOO/) is sent to line
driver U23. Mode 5 data is then transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T3. Whenever
the data buffer is empty, MD5 IRQ/ is active; and the DSP writes the next data word via
the 16-bit data bus to U20. When all words have been sent the DSP disables MD5 IRQ/.
Mode 7 Transmit Data: On receipt of a command from the surface to transmit Mode 7
data, the DSP enables interrupt MD5 IRQ/ and writes the first word of the requested data
via the 16-bit data bus to the FPGA’s (U20) Mode 7 encoder logic. The data is converted
from parallel to serial format by U20. The U20 6409 Harris Manchester equivalent
encoder receives serial data and the encoded data (M7 BZO/ and M7 BOO/) is sent to line
driver U52. Mode 7 data is then transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T4. Whenever
the data buffer is empty, MD5 IRQ/ is active; and the DSP writes the next data word via
the 16-bit data bus to U5. When all words have been sent the DSP disables MD5 IRQ/.

blocks. After each 2k-bytes block is downloaded it is automatically uploaded and
compared with what was downloaded. If all compares with what was sent, the next
2k-byte block is downloaded. If there was a compare error, the test software will
ask if you want to retry or cancel. Retry once or twice and if the download
continues to fail, cancel the download and fix the problem. Check Mode2
communications and possibly reset the tool and test setup. It takes approximately
two minutes to download the file. There are a number of indicators that can be
monitored while the file is downloading. The green LED (D2) will change
transitions on each 2k-byte download. There is a progress bar (Figure 10) on the
PC test software that can be monitored. Also, the Client Information Window
(Figure 11) will update on each 2k-byte download.

Connect the PC Test System (Figure 1).
2.
Remove Jumper between EP1 and EP2 if it is in place.
3.
Apply power to the tool if it is not already powered and start PC Test Software.
4.
Connect the scope as indicated and press the reset button (S1). This will cause the
DAQ board to go through a series of eight test acquisitions using the test signal
shown in Figure 16. Each test acquisition changes the DAC gain value starting
with gain step 8, and the FPGA produces a step function that is synchronized to the
Test Fire (TP53). Figure 35 shows the gain value (G1) on scope channel 1, what
the test signal looks like at test point 1 B and what it looks like at 1 C after the filter
section. Table 1 lists the gain steps and values. This is a good test for checking the
DAC, Analog circuits and A/Ds.


OBSERVE:
DAC output data (GAIN1) on channel 2. Each step
represents a new acquisition and a change in gain. Verify
that each step is the same value as indicated in the
following table. The first step is gain step 8 the next is gain
step 9 and the second to last one is gain step 15 then the
DAC is reset back to gain step 0. Also check G2 (GAIN2),
G3 (GAIN3), and G4 (GAIN4). If Channel 2 does not look
similar to the scope picture continue on to the next step to
verify references.

3212PA-MREX-AMO,Field Safety - 1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION,"GENERAL INFORMATION
THIS TOOL PRESENTS SEVERAL UNIQUE SAFETY ISSUES.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
THEY BE REVIEWED AND MADE KNOWN TO ALL PERSONS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY
TO THE TOOL DURING ITS TRANSPORT AND OPERATION.
IN ORDER TO PREVENT PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR EQUIPMENT DAMAGE, IT IS
ALSO IMPORTANT THAT ONLY TRAINED PERSONNEL OPERATE AND/OR
MAINTAIN THIS TOOL.
This module captures potential equipment failure hazards that are located throughout the 3212 PA and
3206 MRIL Manuals as ""CAUTION"" items because with their occurrence they can present a human
hazard."
3212PA-MREX-AMO,Field Safety - 1.1 TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING,"TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING
3212 PA SPECIFIC:
WARNING
THE 3212 PA OPERATES AT DANGEROUS VOLTAGE LEVELS (600 TO 900
VOLTS).  THE TOOL CAN ALSO STORE A DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF
ELECTRICAL ENERGY (630 J).  TO INSURE THAT THE TOOL IS FULLY
DISCHARGED AFTER A LOGGING RUN, ALWAYS USE THE FOLLOWING
PROCEDURE:
!
After NMR data acquisition is complete, reduce the output of the surface DC+/DC- power
supply (2010 or 2085) to zero while the NMR transmitter is firing.
!
Next, turn off the High Voltage Enable relay in the 3206 ED via the ECLIPS system.
!
Then turn off the DC+/DC- power supply unless it is needed by another tool.
!
Leave the WTS AC power on until the tool is near the surface if the well bore temperature is
above 85 C (185 F).  The 3212 PA contains a low voltage charger circuit which is powered
o
o
by the 180 Vac supply (refer to 130766-945 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION).  This circuit
supplies 100 Vdc to the capacitor bank whenever the 180 Vac is applied to the tool - even
when the High Voltage Enable is disabled.  Be sure to set the Amplitude to ""0"" when cycling
the tool with the magnet exposed on the surface or inside casing.  This voltage protects the
electrolytic capacitors from damage at high temperature.
!
Avoid touching any of the contacts on either the top or bottom of the 3212 PA while handling
the tool, unless it has first been verified with a meter that there is no voltage between any of
the pins/sockets.  ALWAYS ASSUME THE TOOL MAY HAVE RETAINED AN

3212 PA NMR CAP/CHARGER -- FIELD SAFETY

TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING   cont'd
!
Caution should be used when testing or working on the tool outside of its housing.  The
capacitor array is normally insulated by a fiberglass sleeve.  However, DANGEROUS
VOLTAGE IS EXPOSED ON ALL OF THE CIRCUIT BOARDS.  Therefore, power
down the tool and, before touching any component or terminal on the circuit boards or chassis
mounted components:
VERIFY THAT THE CAPACITORS ARE DISCHARGED BY USING A METER TO
READ THE VOLTAGE BETWEEN TERMINALS E5 & E6 ON THE JUMPER
BOARD LOCATED NEAR THE TOP OF THE TOOL.
!
Use care when handling the 3212 PA as with other heavy equipment.
3212 PA in MRIL Tool String:
!
The magnet will permanently loose all magnetism at wellsite/transportation temperatures at or
below -20 CE (-4 EF).  This is an immediate-action occurrence with no graduation affects.
The magnetism will not return as the temperature warms above -20 EC (-4 EF).  It will need to
be re-characterized at the NUMAR facilities.
!
Persons who wear cardiac pacemakers, have ferro-metal particularly or any other metal type
in/on their bodies MUST NOT BE NEAR the MRIL Tool due to its potentially hazardous
effects from the permanent magnetic field and/or from accidental RF radiation exposure.
Mechanical wrist watches also can be affected by the magnetic field.
!
Remove all magnetic retention media such as credit cards/bank cards, computer discs, logging
tapes, CRTs and other analyzer screens, from close proximity to the Antenna /Magnet probe.
The Probe's magnetic field will alter these magnetized media devices.
!
Do not transport other logging tools with the Antenna/Magnet Probe.  Keep all instruments
with photo-multiplier tubes at least 12 feet from the magnet probe.  The Probe's magnets will
change the alignment of the plates in a PM-tube causing the output to change, the
discriminator to need adjustment, and the tools to need re-calibration.  Tool housings in close

3212 PA NMR CAP/CHARGER -- FIELD SAFETY

TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING   cont'd
!
Never attempt to stop a Antenna/Magnet Probe from being drawn magnetically towards a
metal wall, floor, or drill pipe.  The Probe can very forcefully roll or move towards the metal
surface without personnel being able to stop it.  Persons close to the tool must be warned of
the hazards of having a hand, arm, or foot caught between the metal wall, floor, or pipe and
the Antenna/Magnet Probe.
!
Thread protectors must be installed when lifting or transporting the tool sections.  Use of a
crane, hoist, or other mechanical device is required to lift the instrument.  The 3206 MRIL
Tool/Antennae/Magnet Probe weighs about 1900 lb (860 kg) when this cartridge is in its
transport case.  The tool, when fully assembled, weighs over 1100 lbs (408 kg) with 45% of
this weight at the Antenna/Magnet Probe.
!
The 3207/8 MB magnet and the 3206 ED, 3212 PA (or 3206 PA) must be lifted and transported
separately or tool damage can occur.  When shipping by commercial aircraft, the 3207/8 MB
magnet must be shipped inside its transport container to conform to IATA shipping
regulations for magnetic devices.  This container is very heavy (. 1350 lbs/613 kg) and will
require special handling.

3212PA-MREX-AMO,Field Safety - 1.2 ON-SITE HAZARDS,"ON-SITE HAZARDS
!
Never operate the transmitter in open air with the antenna cartridge connected.
The only exception is when the tool is inside of the FARADAY CAGE/CALIBRATOR.  The
tool emits a powerful electromagnetic field (RF signal) that is a potential human HEALTH
RISK.  It is a violation of Government regulations to transmit on the surface; doing so could
result in a fine.
!
The 3212 PA contains a low voltage charger circuit that is powered by the 180 Vac supply
(see Circuit Description).  This circuit supplies 100 VDC to the capacitor bank whenever 180
Vac is applied to the tool - EVEN WHEN THE HIGH VOLTAGE ENABLE IS DISABLED.
Be sure to set the Amplitude to ""0"" when cycling the tool with the magnet exposed on the
surface or inside casing.
!
The 3206 MRIL Tool operates at very high power levels.  Be aware that whenever the tool
has exposed electrical contacts - feed throughs and cartridge connectors - that this condition is
a potentially lethal voltage source and should be considered as such until it is CERTAIN that
no danger exists.
!
If any checkout procedures are attempted while the tool is warm/hot, all personnel
should be positioned well away from directly over the Probe's check valve.  The
valve could be at or close to its pressure release point and unexpectedly spray a 12 -
18"" stream of hot hydraulic oil.

RIGGING UP - (At the Well Site)
!
The 3207/8 MB Antenna/Magnet Probe should be rigged up independently of the 3206 ED.

THIS TOOL PRESENTS SEVERAL UNIQUE SAFETY ISSUES.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
THESE BE REVIEWED AND MADE KNOWN TO ALL PERSONS IN CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO THE TOOL DURING ITS TRANSPORT AND OPERATION.
IN ORDER TO PREVENT PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR EQUIPMENT DAMAGE, IT IS
ALSO IMPORTANT THAT ONLY TRAINED PERSONNEL OPERATE AND/OR
MAINTAIN THIS TOOL."
3212PA-MREX-AMO,Lab Safety - 1.1 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS,"SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
This section lists potential equipment failure hazards that are located throughout the 3212 PA and 3206
MRIL Manuals as WARNING items because their occurrence can present a human hazard.
3212 PA SPECIFIC:
WARNING
THE 3212 PA OPERATES AT DANGEROUS VOLTAGE LEVELS (600 TO 900
VOLTS).  THE TOOL CAN ALSO STORE A DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF
ELECTRICAL ENERGY (630 J).  TO INSURE THAT THE TOOL IS FULLY
DISCHARGED AFTER A LOGGING RUN, ALWAYS USE THE FOLLOWING
PROCEDURE:
!
After NMR data acquisition is complete, reduce the output of the surface DC+/DC- power
supply (2010 or 2085) to zero while the NMR transmitter is firing.
!
Next, turn off the High Voltage Enable relay in the 3206 ED via the ECLIPS system.
!
Then turn off the DC+/DC- power supply unless it is needed by another tool.
!
Leave the WTS AC power on if the tool temperature is above 85 C (185 F).  The 3212 PA
o
o
contains a low voltage charger circuit which is powered by the 180 Vac supply (refer to the
Circuit Description document 130766-945)).  This circuit supplies 66 Vdc to the capacitor
bank whenever the 180 Vac is applied to the tool - even when the High Voltage Enable is
disabled.  Be sure to set the Amplitude to ‘0' when cycling the tool with the magnet exposed
on the surface or inside casing.  This voltage protects the electrolytic capacitors from damage
at high temperature.
!
Avoid touching any of the contacts on either the top or bottom of the 3212 PA while handling
the tool, unless it has been verified with a meter that there is no voltage between any of the
pins/sockets.  ALWAYS ASSUME THE TOOL MAY HAVE RETAINED AN

3212 PA NMR CAP/CHARGER -- LAB SAFETY
1.1  SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS   cont'd
!
Caution should be used when testing or working on the tool outside of its housing.  The
capacitor array is normally insulated by a fiberglass sleeve.  However, DANGEROUS
VOLTAGE IS EXPOSED ON ALL OF THE CIRCUIT BOARDS.  Therefore, power
down the tool and, before touching any component or terminal on the circuit boards or chassis
mounted components:
VERIFY THE CAPACITORS ARE DISCHARGED BY USING A METER TO READ
THE VOLTAGE BETWEEN TERMINALS E5 & E6 ON THE JUMPER BOARD
LOCATED NEAR THE TOP OF THE TOOL.
!
Use care when handling the 3212 PA as with other heavy equipment.
3212 PA in MRIL Tool String
!
Persons who wear cardiac pacemakers, have ferro-metal particularly or any other metal type
in/on their bodies MUST NOT BE NEAR the MRIL Tool due to the potentially hazardous
effects from the permanent magnetic field and/or from accidental RF radiation exposure.
!
The 3206 MRIL Tool operates at very high power levels that are potentially a human hazard.
Be aware that whenever the tool has exposed electrical contacts - feed throughs and cartridge
connectors, or the housing is removed for servicing - that this condition is a lethal voltage
source and should be considered as such until it is CERTAIN that no danger exists.
!
The formation water in the Faraday Cage Calibrator is ""doped"" with poisonous Cupric
Sulfate (CuSO ).  Before handling the Cupric Sulfate solution, the Material Safety Data Sheet
4
and the Manufacturer's precautions (printed on the Cupric Sulfate label) MUST BE read and
the directions followed explicitly.  Store the solution in accordance with Baker Atlas safety
policy for hazardous substances.
!
Remove all magnetic retention media such as credit cards/bank cards, computer discs, logging
tapes, etc, from close proximity to the Antenna/Magnet Probe.  There is a distinct probability
that the Antenna/Magnet Probe's magnetic field will alter these magnetized media.
!
Any orientation tools must be kept at least 10 ft (3 m) from the Antenna/Magnet Probe.
Keep all instruments with photo-multiplier tubes at least 12 ft (3.6 m) from the
Antenna/Magnet Probe.  Magnets will change the alignment of the plates in a PM-tube causing
the output to change, the discriminator to need adjustment and the tool to need recalibration.
Some tool housings in close proximity to the Antenna/Magnet Probe can become magnetized

3212 PA NMR CAP/CHARGER -- LAB SAFETY
1.1  SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS   cont'd
!
Never attempt to stop a Antenna/Magnet Probe from being drawn magnetically towards a
metal wall, floor, or drill pipe.  The Probe can very forcefully roll or move towards the metal
surface without personnel being able to stop it.  Persons close to the tool must be warned of
the hazards of having a hand, arm, or foot caught between the metal wall, floor, or pipe and
the Antenna/Magnet Probe.
!
The 3206 MA Antenna/Magnet Probe weighs over 1000 pounds when it is in its transport
case.  The MRIL tool itself, when fully assembled, weighs over 1100 pounds with 45% of this
weight at the Antenna/Magnet Probe.  NO ATTEMPT should be made to lift the tool without
the aid of a pickup crane, forklift, or hoist.
!
It may be necessary to set the coupling on the BlackBox during verification tests.  The tool
must be powered down before attempting this adjustment.  Adjusting the coupling while the
tool is transmitting could cause serious injury and tool damage.
!
Never operate the transmitter in open air with the Antenna/Magnet Probe connected.  The
only exception is when the tool is fully inside the FARADAY CAGE / CALIBRATOR.  The
tool emits a powerful electromagnetic field that is a potential HEALTH RISK, and because it
is operating at AM radio frequencies, it is also in VIOLATION OF GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS to transmit on the surface.  This could result in costly penalties or fines.
!
If any checkout procedures are attempted while the tool is warm/hot, all personnel
should be positioned well away from directly over the Probe's check valve.  The
valve could be at or close to its pressure release point and unexpectedly spray a 12 -
18"" stream of hot hydraulic oil.

1.0  TOOL DESCRIPTION
Capacitor Array:  (Ref. dwg. #’s 192547-100 and 192498-000).  The capacitor array is made up of
1260 individual 220 FF/100 V wet-slug tantalum capacitors.  These capacitors are connected in a
series-parallel network of 36 modules with 35 capacitors each.
The capacitors in each module are wired in parallel.  Nine modules are wired in series to form a
string.  Four series strings are then wired in parallel to form an array.  The array has 3,500 FF of
capacitance and is rated for 600 V at 175 EC.  The capacitance of the array is nearly flat (+.024%/EC)
with temperature and DC voltage.
Capacitor Description:  The wet-slug tantalum capacitor is primarily used in high reliability and
harsh environmental applications (military, aerospace and downhole) where cheaper capacitor
technologies, such as aluminum electrolytic and solid tantalum, are inadequate.
Capacitor Failure Modes:  Capacitor failure can be generally divided into three types; excessive
loss or gain of capacitance, excessive leakage current, and physical failure.
The capacitance of wet-slug tantalum capacitors increases early in life, then slowly decreases late in
life.  Similarly, their insulation leakage currents decrease early in life and slowly increase late in life.
Insulation leakage currents also increase with temperature.
These capacitors are virtually immune to internal short-circuit failure.  Their most common problem is
seal or case failure usually caused by excessive AC ripple current, which causes self-heating, or
mechanical damage of the seal from mishandling during assembly.
The AC ripple current seen by each capacitor is very low (<3.3mA RMS in a 880mA at 1kHz rated
capacitor) in this tool.
The leads on these capacitors are bent on a special bending jig to minimize stress on the seals and
weld joints.
WARNING
THE WET-SLUG TANTALUM CONTAINS A LIQUID, ACIDIC ELECTROLYTE
WHICH IS POISONOUS AND CORROSIVE.  THE CAPACITORS ARE
ENCAPSULATED IN THE MODULES TO CONTAIN THE ELECTROLYTE
SHOULD A LEAK DEVELOP.
Service Life:  Below 85 EC, wet-slug tantalum capacitors have a service life of 10 to 20 years.  At
higher temperatures, their life gets shorter.  The capacitor manufacturers claim lifetimes of 300 to 900
hours continuous duty at 175 EC.  One of the manufacturers states that the tantalum case of the
capacitor can become brittle and crack after 900 hours at 175 EC.  Since this tool is only rated for
150 EC, such embrittlement should be of little concern as tantalum is inert at temperatures below

3212 PA NMR CAP/CHARGER -- REPAIR/MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
1.0  TOOL DESCRIPTION   cont'd
Loss of electrolyte will cause a capacitor to become an open circuit.  If electrolyte leaks from the
encapsulated modules into the interior of the tool, corrosion and insulation leakage problems will
result.
Life testing shows only a slight increase in capacitance (.042% for Mallory THD220) and a decrease
(-53.5% for Mallory THD220) in leakage current after 320 hours of simulated NMR service at 175 EC
with no failures.  The operational lifetime of the capacitors should be at least 1500 hours of NMR
logging operation.
Maintenance:  Perform the leakage tests listed in this document and record the results.  If an abrupt
decrease in capacitance or increase in leakage current (> -3% for capacitance and > +20% for
leakage) is observed, inspect the capacitor modules and wiring for signs of physical damage.  If none
is found, then determine which of the four banks of modules is the source of the problem.  Next,
locate the defective module.
Replacement modules are available in groups of nine (192498-500).  If a module is defective, all of
the modules in that series string should be replaced as a group.  The failure of one module will
possibly over-stress the other modules in the same series string.
A series string of modules forms a voltage divider.  Modules with capacitors from  different
manufacturers, or even manufacturing lot numbers, will have different characteristics.  This
will cause an uneven division of voltage across the modules and cause poor reliability.
All of the 3212 PA tools (to date) have been assembled with either Tansitor or Mallory capacitors.  In
either case, only one vendor’s capacitors have been used in a tool.  This was primarily done to insure
that all capacitors within each series string have similar capacitance, leakage current and aging
characteristics.
Tansitor and Mallory capacitors may be used in the same tool, ONLY if all the capacitors in a
series string are from the same vendor, and preferably from the same lot.
To determine which vendor’s capacitors are in a given module, inspect the glass seals around the wire
at the positive end of the module.  The letter “P” is machined into the top of the positive end of each
module.  The glass seal (.14 in. dia.) on the Mallory caps is noticeably smaller in diameter than the
glass seal (.19 in. dia.) on the Tansitor caps.
Periodically inspect the capacitor module wiring in the slot in the sides of the modules, as listed in the
LEVEL 3 MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES  (130766-953).  Look for signs of charred insulation or
vaporized wires.  Be certain the capacitor module wire slot is kept clean and free of metal fragments
and other conductive debris.
A short circuit in this area can cause wires to vaporize and char insulation!
The capacitors are very well protected and conservatively rated for any well logging job that is within
the temperature specifications of the NMR tool.  As a result, they should have a long lifetime.

NOTE:
Vmax for this test: 600 V.
1.
Remove just enough of the tool from the housing to expose the Jumper board.  Please refer to
the 130766-955 ASSEMBLY/DISASSEMBLY procedures.
2.
Set both Plug boards (190378-000) to the ""OFF"" position by unplugging them (if necessary)
and rotating them until the word ""OFF"" is upright and beneath the function names on the
Jumper board (190377-000).  Then re-seat the Plug boards in the ""OFF"" position.
3.
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 1.  DMM1 is in mA current mode and DMM2 is
in VDC mode.
4.
Make sure the 2010 high voltage is off.
5.
Turn on the AC POWER switch on the 2010.  The VOLTS control pot on the 2010 (or
2085) must be set  to zero (fully CCW), or the high voltage will not come on.   Push the red
HV ON button to turn the high-voltage on.  Slowly advance the VOLTS pot while watching
the CURRENT display on the 2010 and the two DMMs.  Note, the CURRENT pot must be
set to maximum (fully CW).
6.
DMM2 should show a rising voltage and the current shown in DMM1 should remain low
(<.30 A; it will go higher if the VOLTS pot is advanced too rapidly).  DMM1 should go to
near zero when advancing of theVOLTS pot is stopped.  If these conditions are met, continue

3212 PA NMR CAP/CHARGER -- REPAIR/MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
2.2  CAPACITOR ARRAY TEST PROCEDURE   cont'd
7.
Continue advancing the VOLTS pot until DMM2 reaches 600 V.  The current shown by
DMM1 should continue to decrease as the capacitor array charges.  Switch DMM1 to the µA
scale as needed.  After several minutes the leakage current should fall below 140µA.  It will
be necessary to temporarily disconnect DMM2 to get this result.  If the leakage current fails
to fall to at least 140µA (allow at least 10 min.), a leakage failure in the capacitor array may
exist.  Record the final leakage value.  Change DMM1 to the Amps position and reconnect
DMM2.
8.
Turn the VOLTS pot down to zero.  Then push the green HV OFF button to turn off the high
voltage.  After DMM2 is below 1 V, turn the 2010 power supply AC POWER switch off.
Then short-out the capacitor array by connecting a jumper wire from E5 to E6 on the Jumper
board.
9.
Remove the jumper wire between E5 and E6.  Use the CR50 capacitance meter to measure
the capacitance of the capacitor array.  Please observe polarity.  The positive lead (red) from
the CR50 is connected to E5 on the Jumper board.  The negative lead (black) is connected to
E6.  The capacitance meter should read between 3.40mF (milli Farad) and 3.8mF.
Disconnect the CR50 and record the capacitance value.
10.
Set the Capacitor Charger Conn.  Plug board to the ""ON"" position.  The Tandem Capacitor
Cartridge Plug board should stay in the ""OFF"" position.  Push the tool back into the housing
and close it up.  Please refer to 130766-955 ASSEMBLY/DISASSEMBLY PROCEDURES.

3.
Connect the Common Remote to the top end of the 3212 PA tool, and connect the Field Test
box  to the bottom end of the tool.  The common Remote is to be connected to an ECLIPS
system via a 7-conductor wireline.
4.
Connect one of the Fluke 87s (DMM1 in DC mA mode) across the CURRENT test jacks on
the test box.  Connect the other Fluke 87 (DMM2 in DC V mode) across the HV+ and HV-
test jacks.
5.
Make sure that the Capacitor Charger Conn. Plug board is in the “ON” position and that the
Tandem Capacitor Cartridge Plug board is in the “OFF” position.
6.
Turn on the AC POWER switch on the 2010.  The VOLTS control pot on the 2010 must
be set  to zero (fully CCW), or the high voltage will not come on.  Push the red HV ON
button to turn the high-voltage on.  Slowly advance the VOLTS pot while watching the two
DMMs.  NOTE: the CURRENT pot must be set to maximum (fully CW).
7.
DMM2 should show a rising voltage and the current shown in DMM1 should remain low
(<.30 A; it will go higher if the VOLTS pot is advanced too rapidly).  DMM1 should go to
near zero when you stop advancing the VOLTS pot.  If these conditions are met, continue
advancing the VOLTS pot while watching the DMMs.
8.
Continue advancing the VOLTS pot until DC+ to DC- is set to 620 V (connect DMM2 to
DC+ & DC-to measure this).
9.
HV+ to HV- should stop advancing and stay fixed at 600 V ± 2 V (reconnect DMM2 to
%
HV+ & HV-).
10.
Advance the VOLTS pot again until DC+ to DC- is set to 700 V (connect DMM2 to DC+
& DC-to measure this).
11.
DMM1 should show an idle current between 7.0mA and 8.0mA and DMM2 should be
%
between 598 V and 602 V.

Remove tool from housing using the procedure listed in 130766-955.

Perform the capacitor array tests listed in 130766-956.

Inspect the cases of R8, R9, R20 and R21 on the Main board (190375-000) for cracks, loose
epoxy end-caps and poor epoxy-to-wire seals.

Inspect the wiring slot in the sides of the capacitor modules.  Look for signs of charred
insulation or vaporized wires.  Be certain that the wiring slot in the modules is kept clean of
metal fragments and conductive debris.  A short circuit in this area can cause wires to
vaporize and char insulation!

DC- is 700 V.  Adjust the resistor substitution box until HV+ to HV- equals 600 V.  To get the best
resistor value, find and note the resistor box settings for 599 V and 601 V.  Then set the resistor box
to the value half way in between the 599 V and 601 V values (DMM2 should show 600 V).
Remember, decrease the resistance to raise the output voltage.
Power down the tool.  Remove the resistor box and measure its value and clip-lead the nearest value

3213QB-MREX-AMO,Brief Description of Service - 1.0 OVERVIEW,"1.0  OVERVIEW
The 3213 QB was designed and built to provide faster charging rate to one or two MRIL 3206 PA
Energy Storage Sections.
The 3213 QB Capacitor Charger was designed primarily to provide a fast capacitor charging circuit
necessary for newly introduced logging programs with additional energy requirements for the MRIL
service.  This capability is needed when recording long echo trains (carbonate logging) and when
logging in low Q boreholes (salt based muds)."
3213QB-MREX-AMO,Field Safety - 1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION,"GENERAL INFORMATION
THIS TOOL PRESENTS SEVERAL UNIQUE SAFETY ISSUES.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
THEY BE REVIEWED AND MADE KNOWN TO ALL PERSONS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY
TO THE TOOL DURING ITS TRANSPORT AND OPERATION.
IN ORDER TO PREVENT PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR EQUIPMENT DAMAGE, IT IS
ALSO IMPORTANT THAT ONLY TRAINED PERSONNEL OPERATE AND/OR
MAINTAIN THIS TOOL.
This module captures potential equipment failure hazards that are located throughout the 3213 QB and
3206 MRIL Manuals as ""CAUTION"" items because with their occurrence they can present a human
hazard."
3213QB-MREX-AMO,Field Safety - 1.1 TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING,"TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING
3213 QB SPECIFIC:
WARNING
THE 3213 QB OPERATES AT DANGEROUS VOLTAGE LEVELS (600 TO 900
VOLTS).  THE TOOL, WHEN COMBINED WITH A 3206 PA, CAN ALSO STORE A
DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY (310 J).  TO INSURE THAT
THE TOOL IS FULLY DISCHARGED AFTER A LOGGING RUN, ALWAYS USE
THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE:
!
After NMR data acquisition is complete, reduce the output of the surface DC+/DC- power
supply (2010 or 2085) to zero while the NMR transmitter is firing.
!
Next, turn off the High Voltage Enable relay in the 3206 ED via the ECLIPS system.
!
Then turn off the DC+/DC- power supply unless it is needed by another tool.
!
Avoid touching any of the contacts on either the top or bottom of the 3212 PA while handling
the tool, unless it has first been verified with a meter that there is no voltage between any of
the pins/sockets.  ALWAYS ASSUME THE TOOL MAY HAVE RETAINED AN


TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING   cont'd
!
Caution should be used when testing or working on the tool outside of its housing.
DANGEROUS VOLTAGE IS EXPOSED ON BOTH OF THE CIRCUIT BOARDS.
Therefore, power down the tool before touching any component or terminal on the circuit
boards or chassis mounted components:
VERIFY THAT THE CAPACITOR IS DISCHARGED BY USING A METER TO
READ THE VOLTAGE BETWEEN TERMINALS E1 & E2 ON THE MAIN BOARD.
!
Use care when handling the 3213 QB as with other heavy equipment.
3213 QB in MRIL Tool String:
!
The magnet will permanently loose all magnetism at wellsite/transportation temperatures at or
below -20 CE (-4 EF).  This is an immediate-action occurrence with no graduation affects.
The magnetism will not return as the temperature warms above -20 EC (-4 EF).  It will need to
be re-characterized at the NUMAR facilities.
!
Persons who wear cardiac pacemakers, have ferro-metal particularly or any other metal type
in/on their bodies MUST NOT BE NEAR the MRIL Tool due to its potentially hazardous
effects from the permanent magnetic field and/or from accidental RF radiation exposure.
Mechanical wrist watches also can be affected by the magnetic field.
!
Remove all magnetic retention media such as credit cards/bank cards, computer discs, logging
tapes, CRTs and other analyzer screens, from close proximity to the Antenna /Magnet probe.
The Probes magnetic field will alter these magnetized media devices.
!
Do not transport other logging tools with the Antenna/Magnet Probe.  Any orientation tools
must be kept at least 10 ft (3 m) from the Antenna/Magnet Probe.  Keep all instruments with
photo-multiplier tubes at least 12 feet (3.6 m) from the magnet probe.  The Probe's magnets
will change the alignment of the plates in a PM-tube causing the output to change and the
discriminator to need adjustment and the tools' re-calibration.  Tool housings in close

Thread protectors must be installed when lifting or transporting the tool sections.  Use of a
crane, hoist, or other mechanical device is required to lift the instrument.  The 3206 MRIL
Tool/Antenna/Magnet Probe weighs about 1900 lb (860 kg) when this cartridge is in its
transport case.  The tool, when fully assembled, weighs over 1100 lbs (408 kg) with 45% of
this weight at the Antenna/Magnet Probe.
!
The 3207/8 MB magnet and the 3206 ED, 3212 PA (or 3206 PA) must be lifted and transported
separately or tool damage can occur.  When shipping by commercial aircraft, the 3207/8 MB
magnet must be shipped inside its transport container to conform to IATA shipping
regulations for magnetic devices.  This container is very heavy ( . 1350 lbs/613 kg) and will
require special handling.

!
Persons who wear cardiac pacemakers, have ferro-metal particularly or any other metal type
in/on their bodies MUST NOT BE NEAR the MRIL Tool due to the potentially hazardous
effects from the permanent magnetic field and/or from accidental RF radiation exposure.
!
The 3206 MRIL Tool operates at very high power levels that are potentially a human hazard.
Be aware that whenever the tool has exposed electrical contacts, feed-throughs and cartridge
connectors, or the housing is removed for servicing - this condition is a lethal voltage source
and should be considered as such until it is CERTAIN that no danger exists.
!
The formation water in the Faraday Cage Calibrator is ""doped"" with poisonous Cupric
Sulfate (CuSO ).  Before handling the Cupric Sulfate solution, the Material Safety Data Sheet
4
and the Manufacturer's precautions (printed on the Cupric Sulfate label) MUST BE read and
the directions followed explicitly.  Store the solution in accordance with Baker Atlas safety
policy for hazardous substances.
!
Remove all magnetic retention media such as credit cards/bank cards, computer discs, logging

INTRODUCTION
The primary reason for using this capacitor charger tool is to provide more power to the NMR tool, so
that it can produce more echoes in each echo train.  This requirement is typical of total-porosity
logging.  This is accomplished by charging the capacitor cartridge from a power supply that may be up
to 300 V higher than the 600 V specified NMR Vmax.  By using a higher supply voltage, the capacitor-
charging is always done on the faster part of the RC exponential curve.  The 3213 QB is compatible
with true-mode 7 telemetry.  It can also be used in tool strings with RCI and other tools.  The 3213 QB

3213 QB NMR CAP CHARGER -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
1.0  CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION   cont'd
The capacitor charger tool has two principal circuit functions:
!
The first function is to control the charging of the capacitor cartridge.
!
The second function is to protect the capacitor cartridge and the NMR transmitter from
overvoltage. The most likely cause of overvoltage is the failure of some component in the
charging control circuit. For this reason, the overvoltage protection (OVP) and the charging
control circuits share no components.
The OVP circuit is designed to disconnect the charging control circuit from its power source if the
capacitor cartridge voltage rises above 630 V.  The charging circuit will remain disconnected until the
surface high-voltage power supply is reduced to about 75 V.  The OVP circuit will also discharge the
capacitor cartridge, after it has been tripped.
Detailed Circuit Description: (See the 3213 QB block diagram for an overall view of tool)
Input protection: (See Main board drawing P/N 188353-100).  Both the OVP and charging control
circuits have diodes (D1-D4, D19, & D20) that protect both circuits from possible application of
reverse polarity power.
Overvoltage Protection Circuit: (See Main board drawing P/N 188353-100).  The OVP circuit
contains a +8.2 V zener voltage regulator (R3 & D5), a +5 V precision voltage reference (A1) and a
comparator (A2a).  It also has two relays (K1 & K2) driven by a power MOSFET (Q1).
The comparator (A2a) compares the output of the voltage reference (5 V_OV) to OVSEN.  OVSEN is
the charger’s output, after it has been attenuated by the voltage divider formed by R8, R9 and R10.
When the signal OVSEN rises above 5 V_OV, the comparator turns on Q1.  Q1 energizes the OVP
relays (K1 & K2).  The relays are wired such that they latch in the ""on"" position.  Thus, they will stay
on after Q1 turns off.  Notice that when Q1 is ""off"" it will have the full DC+ to DC- line voltage
across it (this may be as high as 900 V).  The capacitor cartridge is discharged through R1 after the
OVP relays have been turned on.  Diodes D7 and D8 limit the relay coil voltages and provide an
alternate current path in case one of the relay coils is ""open.""

3213 QB NMR CAP CHARGER -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
1.0  CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION   cont'd
Charging Control Circuit: (See Main board drawing P/N 188353-100 and Pass Transistor Array
board drawing P/N 188352-100).  The charging control circuit contains a +8.2 V zener voltage
regulator (R11 & D10), a +5 V precision voltage reference (A3), and a control loop amplifier (A4 &
Q3).  It also has a power zener equivalent circuit (D11, D12, R14, R15 & Q2) and an array of
MOSFET pass-transistors (Q4 on the Main board & Q1 - Q4 on the Pass-Transistor board).
The control loop amplifier tries to keep the output (HV+ to HV-) at 600 V. It does this by comparing
the signal 5 V_CH from the precision voltage reference to HVSEN.  HVSEN is the charger’s output,
after it has been attenuated by the voltage divider formed by R20-R22.  The control op-amp (A4)
drives a power MOSFET (Q3) that is the bottom leg of the voltage divider formed by R16, R18 and
Q3.  The gate control signal (QVGR) for the pass-transistor array is produced at the junction of R16
and R18.
Maximum pass-transistor Vgs drive voltage is produced when Q3 is ""off.""  When Q3 is fully ""on,"" the
Vgs drive voltage of the pass-transistor array is near zero.  Zener diode D14 limits the Vgs range of
QVGR to a maximum of +10 V and a minimum of -.6 V.  The power zener circuit (D11, D12, R14, R15
& Q2) insures that the pass-transistor array always receives at least +8.5 V of Vgs drive as needed for
full enhancement of the power MOSFETs.
In normal operation, the pass-transistor array is fully ""on"" while the capacitor cartridge is being
charged.  After the capacitor cartridge is fully charged to 600 V, the control op-amp lowers the Vgs of
the pass-transistor array to about 3.3 V.  This allows just enough current to go through the pass-
transistor array to maintain 600 V across the capacitor cartridge.  Resistor R19 stabilizes the charging
controller by providing some isolation between the charging controller and the capacitor cartridge.
Balance  circuit: (See Main board drawing P/N 188353-100) The voltage balance network (R23 &
R24) insures that HV+ and HV- are equally balanced with respect to ARMOR.  These resistors also
serve as bleeder resistors that can discharge one 3206 PA from 600 V down to a safe voltage (12 V) in
about 90 min.  They also will  prevent a static charge from building up in a 3206 PA tool when the
3213 QB sub is attached.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
3514 XA and 3514 XB WTS COMMON REMOTE
P/N 130767-935
JULY 2002
This instrument is the downhole telemetry interface for WTS type instruments.  The primary function of the
3514 CR is to act as a repeater of the telemetry channels and to create the WTS Instrument Bus (WTS-IB). 
The 3514 CR does not interpret or take any action with commands that are targeted to other instruments of the
tool string.  This is also true for the data that is sent to the surface from the tools. 
A secondary function is to acquire data from several sensors located in its electronic cartridge and outside of
it.
The curves the instrument is capable of acquiring are the following: Cablehead Tension (with optional
TTRmSM Sub), Caliper (with optional caliper instrument), Borehole Temperature (with optional TTRm
Sub), CCL (with optional CCL instrument), Downhole SP (measured between a tool electrode or a bridle
electrode and armor) and Mud Resistivity (with optional TTRm Sub).
NOTE:
Operations that require an orientation sub should utilize a 4401 XB
instrument.  Operations that require a downhole power sub should use a
4430 XB.
The 3514 XB WTS Common Remote was developed to provide improved long-line performance when using
wirelines up to 40,000 feet in length.  However, the 3514 XA is preferred when using shorter wirelines up to
20,000 feet in length.
The 3514 XB also incorporates improvements in RCI communications and NMR high voltage capabilities."

CONTROLLER SECTION
This is a 6805 based microcontroller circuit designed to perform the following three functions:
1.
Interface directly to the Manchester chip to receive the serial data, interpret and execute
commands and serialize data for Manchester encoding and transmission.
2.
Control the sequence of the data acquisition process and the gathering of data from the A/D.
3.
Finally, all instrument relays and analog switches are energized, latched, or switched by the
controller, and its associated driver circuits.
In addition to the functions noted above, a test socket is provided on board.  (NOT FOR FIELD
USE).
1.1.1
POWER-ON RESET
On power-up, the microcontroller unit or MCU (U18) is held reset by R27 and C11 for a period of
three seconds.  The long time constant was chosen to allow correct startup under various conditions of
instrument power-up, in particular when the variac voltage is turned up very slowly.  D4 across R27
allows rapid discharge of the reset circuit when the instrument is de-energized.  D9 protects U18's
reset pin from negative overshoot and balances out the leakage of D4, at temperature.
1.1.2
CLOCK OSCILLATOR
A crystal clock oscillator package (U16) supplies a 4 MHz clock to the MCU.  Internally, the MCU
divides the clock by 2 and runs at 2 MHz with a period of 0.5 µs.
Observe that U16 has built-in divider stages with outputs supplied to other parts of the system.  One
of these outputs is the 977 Hz clock at pin 1 of U16.  This clock is buffered by a dedicated gate
(U15), to provide a constant amplitude square wave to the mud resistivity circuit.  Regulation is made
possible by deriving the +5 V power supply for U15 from a precision voltage reference in the data
acquisition section rather than using the main logic supply.  The buffered output is made available at
the terminal labeled 977 Hz.
1.1.3
MANCHESTER INTERFACE
Like other instruments in the WTS system, the 3514 Common Remote has its own designated remote
address, which is $80 in this case.  However, with both repeater and local remote residing in the same
package, there was no need to interface its local remote to the Instrument Bus.  Instead, the UDI and
BZO/ signals of the Manchester (U19) tap directly into the repeater via logic elements, thus
eliminating the two coupling transformers, receiver, driver and passive components normally used in
a typical remote.
Interface between U19 and the MCU is straight forward.  Nine of the MCU's programmable I/O ports
were configured for direct handshaking with the Manchester chip.
R28 keeps the Manchester encoder disabled during the brief power-up cycle to avoid unwanted
transmission to the surface.
R29 combines SDI and TD signals to save one MCU port, taking advantage of the fact that, in this
design, the two signals are not required to be active simultaneously.
R33 is a special case pull-down resistor.
1.1.4
RELAY INTERFACE
There are four latching relays in the 3514 CR, one of which, (K2), is located in the controller section
of this card and is used for SP and bridle switching.  The other three are located on the Mud
Resistivity card for mode switching.  In addition, there is the non-latching power relay (K1) mounted
on the chassis for motor supply and other signal routing.  All these relays can operate with a 24 volt
supply.
To avoid having a separate power supply, approximately 24 volts was derived from across the filtered
but unregulated inputs to the ±15 volt regulators, i.e. (V+ to V-).  The common return would be
floating in this supply with V- becoming the return.  The hefty power supplies deliver a fairly stable
voltage when properly powered.  Zener diode (D6) develops 18 volts across its leads leaving about 24
volts to power the relays.  C12 provides additional filtering.
Although load conditions vary widely as one or more relays are switched in different combinations,
this arrangement provides adequate regulation.  The steady state current is low because only K1
requires current to hold it energized.  Pulse duration for the latching relays is 10 msec.
Darlington array (U22) with its built-in EMF protection diodes provides the drive to the individual
coils.  Shift-and-store register (U21) supplies the control signals at its latched outputs to U22.  Data
from the MCU is clocked serially into U21 while the latched outputs of U21 are held undisturbed
until strobed.
Interface between the +5 V logic control signals and the relay driver circuit is accomplished by a
voltage level translation circuit.  Obviously, doing the translation at the three input lines of U21
instead of at the outputs requires fewer components.  For this reason, note that U21 has to be powered
by a net 5 volt supply developed across Zener diode D5 with Vss = -15 V and VDD= -10 V; an
important detail to keep in mind when servicing the circuit.  PNP transistor array (U20) and resistors
R20 through R25 accomplished the translation.
1.1.5
OTHER SWITCHES
When not AC motoring, conductor 7 of the wireline can be utilized for transmitting the mode 7 C
channel.  The channel is transformer-coupled by T6 to the wireline.  T6 is AC coupled to keep from
interfering with SP and DLL remote on Conductor 7 (in the Mode-7 state).  U17 is a CMOS switch
with low 25 ohm on-resistance.  It is configured in the circuit as dual SPDT switches connected in
parallel, thus dropping the on-resistance to one half the noted value.
The MCU controls U17 directly.  In one setting, line 7 gets connected to the SP conductor to provide
an SP signal uphole.  In the other setting, line 7 becomes connected to line 13 of the instrument bus
below the 3514 CR and acts as a DLL surface reference.  It may also be used as an analog signal path
to the surface by some instruments if the need arises.  L4 filters Mode 7 C signals out of the downhole
SP signal.
This switch is open to experimentation.  Being an analog switch, it is well suited for multiplexing
applications.

DATA ACQUISITION SECTION
1.2.1
OVERVIEW
Dictated by the requirements for wide dynamic range, bipolar operation and accuracy of
measurement, the data conversion circuit was designed to accommodate these specifications.  A
reference to the 3514 CR subset documentation should be made for additional information concerning
the application of the converted data.  Further information on each channel is described in the section
about the Sensors Card.
A brief highlight of the configuration is provided below:

resolution and with a 0-10 V input range.
Other features
Two-step Auto-Gain-Ranging scale:

Gain of 2 for input signals exceeding about 600 mV.
2)
Gain of 16 for signals below that value.
Separate sign bit for bipolar signals.
Track and hold amplifier.
External precision 10 V reference for calibration.
16 data channels with a ±5 V input range.
First two dedicated to drift corrections.
1.2.2
ANALOG CHANNEL MULTIPLEXER
As depicted in the circuit diagram, U3 and U4 form the 16-channel analog multiplexer.  All input
terminals, except the first three, are wired to signal channels outside the board.  Ch1 is A/D Zero
reference.  Ch2 is a 580 mV A/D Cal reference derived from the precision 10 V output of U1 by the
voltage divider network R1, R2, and R3.  The third channel represents the flask temperature
(10 mV/° C) and is supplied by U2, a single package, voltage output, temperature sensor.  The three
terminals, connected locally on board, serve as test points.
Channel selection is controlled by four MCU output ports: three directly address one of eight channels
in each multiplexer and a fourth (pin 8 of U18) is the enable control line for U4.  The control signal is
also coupled via R35 to the base of PNP transistor (pin 2 of U20) where it is complemented and used
for driving the enable input of U3.
1.2.3
SIGN INVERTER
The selected analog output, buffered by one of the dual Op Amps in U5, passes through a switchable
sign inverter made up of the second Op Amp in U5, resistors R8, R9, R10 and half of the analog
switches in U10.  When a positive signal is available at both inputs of this amplifier, U5 acts as a
voltage follower with a gain of one, independent of the gain resistor ratios.  For negative signals, the
switch disconnects the non-inverting input from the signal, grounding it through R10 to form an
inverting amplifier with a gain of -1.  Thus, the signal at the output of U5 will always be positive
except possibly during a small window around the zero-crossing threshold for switching.  Precision
resistors R8 and R9 assure a negative unity gain, while a positive 30 mV nominal offset in the
succeeding stage adds to the signal to make it positive all the time in order to satisfy the converter's
unipolar input requirement.
Such offset, conveniently introduced at the track and hold amplifier (U9) by biasing its trim inputs,
must be accounted for after data recovery, together with any other offset and gain drift errors.  The
method involves multiple sampling of the same ZERO and CAL channels under different gain and
sign settings.  Hence, for these channels, the MCU overrides the free running Auto-gain, Auto-sign
operations periodically as will be described shortly.  For other channels, sign control is accomplished
by comparator 2 of U7, which monitors the buffered analog signal in reference to zero.
A comparator offset, if large enough, can shift the zero point beyond the allowable 30 mV window,
leading to erratic sign results.  To avoid using a null trimpot, the signal into the comparator was first
boosted ten times by a low offset amplifier (Op Amp 2 of U6).  In effect, any comparator offset would
then seem reduced by the same factor (in comparison to the input signal of interest) in the vicinity of
the zero-crossing region.
Back-to-back zener diodes D1 and D2 protect U7 by limiting the boosted signal range to safe values.
The sign bit formed at the output of this comparator must be read with the data after conversion.  Its
logic level must be the same immediately before and after conversion to eliminate the possibility of
coding the wrong sign with the converted data.  The output of the comparator itself is not restricted.
Its output through R12 is OR-Tied at pin 3 of U8 with another sign control signal from the MCU.  Pin
3 is the input of one of two latches enabled by a second MCU control signal (pin 7 of U18). When
enabled, the output of the latch (pin 15 of U8) follows the logic state of pin 3.  This is the case during
the signal tracking period in the data acquisition cycle where the latch output dynamically controls the
inverter.  The comparator output is granted control when the MCU floats its output to a high
impedance state.  At other times, the MCU may bring its output high or low to force the sign one way
or the other.
1.2.4
GAIN RANGING AND TRACK/HOLD
Comparator 1 in the dual unit package (U7) generates the Gain Bit.  It compares the signal at the
output of the sign inverter with VTH.  The set point VTH was made slightly higher than the 580 mV
CAL to trip the comparator output high when CAL is sampled.  The desired outcome is a gain of 16.
The reasoning of this should become evident later in the discussion.
Another gain bit control line from the MCU is OR-Tied with the output of the comparator through D3
and R14 to allow either gain bit to appear at the input of the controlled latch (pin 2 of U8).  The latch
output at pin 16 is the Gain Ranging control signal that actually switches the gain at pin 10 of U10,
and it is read with the converted data.  This latch and the sign bit latch have a single enable line
controlled by the MCU signal (pin 7 of U18) mentioned earlier.  Incidentally, the same MCU signal
controls the enable line of a second latch in U8 at pin 4.  The latch holds the CCL Gain Bit generated
at the Sensors card steady during the conversion cycle.
The MCU can grant gain-ranging control to the comparator by bringing its output to a high logic state.
In the calibration cycle, it can force the gain bit low only for a gain of two, unlike in the sign case.
Indirectly, however, the gain can be made 16 for both ZERO and CAL by default under comparator
control.  What makes this possible is the fact that the two signals fall below the comparator threshold
point VTH.
Resistors R15, R16, and R17 form a feedback network around U9 selectable by analog switches in
U10 for gains of 2 or 16.  U9 doubles in function, as a Track and Hold amplifier.  It constantly tracks
the signal present at its input and holds it constant before the conversion cycle starts on command
from the MCU.
R18, in the signal path from U9 to the A/D converter (U11), increased the input range of the
converter by a small amount when an HI1-574 ATD (HARRIS) A/D was used in the 3510 CR.
1.2.5
DATA CONVERSION AND ENCODING
The A/D is configured to convert and provide all 12-bits at its outputs simultaneously when initiated
with a single control pulse at pin 5.  The digital data plus four other binary signals are multiplexed
into four nibbles by data selectors U12 and U13.  The MCU uses a 2-bit ""Nibble Select Bus"" to read
each nibble onto its 4-bit Data Bus as shown in schematic B129980-100.
A third data selector (U14) is controlled by the same MCU port associated with gain ranging;
however, it has nothing to do with gain ranging.  The Manchester data word can accommodate only
16 bits.  Out of those, 12 are occupied by the converted data and one by the Gain Bit; that leaves three
bits.  The SP channel requires that a 3-bit code be transmitted with the data.  One of the bit lines, B2,
is permanently wired for MSB in the 16-bit word while the remaining two, B0 and B1, are routed to
U14.  The SP sign is implied positive and it is not transmitted.  In this case, U14 selects the two code
bits to fill the data word.
In another special case, applicable to the CCL channel, a unique CCL Gain bit must be transmitted.
Here, U14 selects that bit and the sign bit for transmission.  It also retains this selection for other
channels, excluding the SP channel, of course."
3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 2.1 COMMAND CHANNEL ..............................................................................................................6,"COMMAND CHANNEL
This channel receives Manchester words from the surface panel and repeats the words on the
command bus.  Words can be commands or data as determined by the Manchester Sync bits.  A
standard defining the shape and polarity of the signals used in the WTS transmission system has been
specified.
Signals entering the command channel at the 20 kb/s rate of surface to downhole transmission are
amplified and inverted by Op Amp 1 of U1.  Gain pot P1 adjusts the signal level to suit the length,
type, and condition of the wireline in service.  Ideally, the signal should be about 8 to 10 volts p-p as
measured at the COMP IN test terminal.
Mode 2 channel couples to the mode 2 winding on the same modal transformer connected to the
command channel.  The induced command signal in this winding is fed into the non-inverting input of
differential amplifier U1, effectively doubling the signal strength and improving the signal to noise
ratio.  On the other hand, data words on mode 2 channel coupled back into the command channel are
undesirable and are attenuated by this echo cancellation arrangement.
A cascaded RC filter followed by the equalization filter implemented with the second Op Amp of U1,
will reduce the noise and harmonic distortion added to the signal by the wireline.
R6 A (on the repeater card) can be replaced with an optional high-pass active filter card (191656-000).
This filter card filters out 60 Hz noise from the AC motor in an RCI instrument.  (See FMN 99-28.)
This ""Damped Mode 2 Filter"" card allows a greater Mode 2 Tx gain range than was possible with the
1971's Mode 2 filter.
Comparator U2 converts the signal to digital form, triggering at approximately a +/- 2 volt hysteresis
established by its resistor network.  The trigger reference at the non-inverting input of the comparator
flips from one level to another as the output of the comparator changes state and feeds back into R10
at pin 15 of the programmable logic device (U5).    R47 is used to trim R11, to center the trigger
points around the signal baseline.  This centering adjustment removes timing skew in the signal edges
and improves communication (see FMN 95-78 for the 3510).  The feedback, gated by an AND gate in
U5, is inhibited during data transmission on mode 2.  Pin 15 of U5 is forced low during this period to
reset the comparator to a predetermined state.  There are two reasons for this action:  First, to prevent
mode 2 data, induced into the Command channel, from reaching the instrument bus where it may be
interpreted as command words.  Second, to prepare the comparator to trigger on the first edge of the
next command sync.  Otherwise, the comparator may already be in that state and fail to repeat the
correct sync on the Instrument Bus.  The comparator state would have been dependent on the ending
bit in the preceding mode 2 data transmission."

Receives Mode 2 data, processes it, filters it, and sends it up the wireline on Mode 2.
Reliable reception of data at the other end of the wireline requires that the manchester encoded logic
level signal (0,5 V) be modified before transmission. The transmission system is designed to put
shaped, filtered bipolar pulses on the wireline. This process limits the bandwidth required for a
transmission, reduces line charging, and reduces crosstalk to the other data channels. All the data and
clocking information encoded in a manchester signal is represented in the transitions of the logic level
signal. Narrow pulses are generated by the transitions as will be seen in the following description.
At the front end of the receiver, data enters from two separate sources before being OR-tied and
shaped digitally within U5. One source is the Manchester BZO/ output of the local remote.  BZO/
interfaces directly to pin 2 of U5.  The other is the Instrument Bus coupled through T2 to one of the
differential receivers in U4.  The output of U4 is connected to pin 11 of U5. The two merged signals
inside U5 form a single Mode 2 data path which is processed as follows:
First, a logic level change in the merged Mode 2 data in U5 initiates a positive pulse at one of two
corresponding outputs M2 H and M2 L.  In turn, that enables a counter incremented by a 4 MHz
reference clock.  When the count reaches a predetermined number, the counter toggles a flip-flop
ending the pulse and clearing itself.
The pulse width generated on Mode 2 is 5.125 +/- 0.125 µs.  The uncertainty is due to the variable
time difference between the data transition edge and the first clocking edge of the 4 MHz clock.  This
one count jitter amounts to less than 5% and translates into periodic, slight amplitude modulations in
the filtered signal output.  The frequency beating is nonexistent on data emanating from the remote of
the 3514 CR because all system clocks are synchronous.
Second, the data pulses alternating from pins 9 and 10 of U5 are fed into the inputs of a unity-gain
differential amplifier made of Op Amp 2 in U6 and four resistors.  The amplifier passes the pulses at
its noninverting input and inverts the pulses at the other input, converting the two level signal (0, 5 V)
to a three level (-V, 0, +V) alternate mark inversion (AMI) signal. This AMI signal is passed through
a two-pole low-pass Bessel filter (Op Amp 1 in U6) to remove the high frequency edges. The shaped"

This channel receives data only from Mode 5 of the Instrument Bus.  It has a higher bit rate (93.75
kb/s) as specified in the WTS specifications.  Being coupled to the wireline through a separate modal
transformer, feedback into the Command channel is negligible.  No comparator controls were
required.
The Instrument Bus coupling transformer has a higher frequency response than the ones used for
lower speed channels.  The differential input circuit is similar to that of Mode 2, as is the shaping
circuit of U9, which generates narrower pulses in a proportionate manner.  Using an 8 MHz clock, the
jitter remains below 5% for this channel too.
The other stages are practically the same as those of the previous channel with the exception of the
filter circuit.  A single pole RC filter was sufficient for this channel."

The Sensors Card is a collection of independent circuits on a single board, the card processes and/or
filters a dozen analog channels in preparation for sampling.  It also receives the system's precision
10 V reference from the controller and Data Acquisition card to provide a buffered, stable, bridge
supply for the force gage and pressure sensors.  Other references required by some of the sensor
circuits are derived from the 10 volt reference as well.
To a large extent, all circuits were physically partitioned for ease of layout, identification and
servicing.  The channels were labeled from 4 through 15 and are positioned on the card in a sequential
order from left to right.  The same order will be followed here in describing the circuits.

CHANNEL 4 (Unused Ax)
Unused filter Ax.  See CH6 circuit description.  Op Amp U1 is not installed.
3.2 CHANNEL 5 (Unused Ay)
Unused filter Ay.  See filter description below.  Op Amp U2 is not installed.

CHANNEL 6 (Unused Az)
Unused filter Az.
Each filter circuit in the above three channels consists of a 4-pole low pass Bessel filter having a
roll-off frequency of 2 Hz.  It is a classic two stage 2-pole design with parameters yielding an overall
gain of 1.906.  Op Amp U3 is not installed.
A 1 megohm pull down resistor at the input of each circuit keeps it from floating in the absence of a
signal source.

CHANNEL 7 (Force)
Gain and filter circuit for the Force Gage sensor.  The tension/compression load cell in the sensor sub
delivers about 1 mV signal per 1000 lbf, based on the 10 volts of excitation used.  The force scale
required in tension is 12,000 lbf, and is much less in compression.  A ±12 mV input range
specification covers both scales equally, however, with the positive polarity implying tension.
Input instrumentation amplifier U4 has its gain set at 401.  The resulting full scale signal would be
approximately ±4.8 volts, well within the ±5v input range of the data conversion section.  At this
scale, the system can resolve three lbs.
A 2-pole low-pass filter following the gain stage rolls off the signal (-3dB) at about 6 Hz.
When the sensor sub is not installed, resistors at the input of the amplifier keep the output from

CHANNEL 8 (Caliper)
This channel is for processing the caliper signal.  The circuit is similar to that for channel 7. U6 has a
gain of 1, with no connection between its pins 1 and 4.  R33 and R34, together with resistor R92,
form a ""divide by 3"" attenuator similar to the caliper input in the 3506 PCM and 3516 SLAM adapter.
The low-pass filter rolls off (-3db) at about 4 Hz.
R93 works with C54 to provide additional high-frequency noise filtering.  R93 is also a dropping
resistor for the input protection zeners.  This circuit protects the input if top block #2 is accidentally
installed when the 3514 is below a 4430 XB (see FMN 00-13).

This is an unused pressure sub temperature channel.  OpAmps U8 and U9 are not installed.  The ""TP""
input wire is connected to circuit common and provides an isolated return path for the ""TH"" RTD in
the sensors sub.  (See 3510/3981 FMN 94-37/94-37 A.)

CHANNEL 10 (Hole Temp)
Hole temperature circuit Th.  A constant current source, implemented using differential amplifier
U10, drives the RTD.  The signal developed across the sensor is amplified by U11.  C18, in the
feedback loop, filters any high frequency noise past the 11 Hz roll off frequency.
Offset and Scale adjustments were avoided in this circuit, and Channel 10's accuracy relies on the
precision of the components used.  A formula derived in terms of the output voltage is solved for
temperature.  A 500 ohm RTD with an alpha=.00385 is in the sensors sub; consequently, the gain of
the output amplifier was set to 5 by the ratio of resistors R38 and R37.  If the sensors sub uses a 2000
ohm RTD in the future, then R38 and R37 can be swapped for a gain of 1.25 while continuing to use
the same formula.

CHANNEL 11 (Unused TA)
This is an unused buffer channel, and the circuit is simply a buffer for an AD590 temperature sensor
with a 10 K scale resistor.  At the time of this manual's publication, no signal input is connected to
terminal TA.

CHANNEL 12 (CCL)
Channel 12 focuses on the CCL signal.  When digitizing the CCL pulse, it is desirable to preserve the
shape and polarity of the waveform.  This requires higher sampling rates in general.  The multiple
sampling capabilities of ECLIPS will make it feasible to achieve this result, as the circuit does not
employ any peak detectors.
The level of CCL signal can span a wide dynamic range due to large variations in the strength of the
magnetic field encountered and more than one type of CCL subs that may be adapted for use with the
WTS system.
Normally, the measurement is not intended for cased hole operations with flush joints.  Nevertheless,
the sensitivity range of the circuit was extended to cover weak signals.
The signal received on conductors 16 and 10 of the upper instrument bus is passively filtered by the
input RC stage leading to instrumentation amplifier U14.  D1 and D2 protect the device from peaks
exceeding ±12 volts.  Additional filtering is done by the 2-pole active filter around Op Amp 1 in U15
for an overall flat response up to about 4 Hz.  From there, the signal splits entering a window
comparator and a two-step scale adjustment circuit encompassing the 2nd Op Amp in U15 and analog
switch U17.  The output of the comparator, CCL GB, is latched on the Controller and A/D card
before data conversion and the latched output, Q2, is used to control the scale.  For signals outside the
range of ±80 mV, the window comparator selects the node between R58 and R59 as the feedback path
to the inverting amplifier.  In this case, the circuit behaves as an attenuator, stepping down the input
voltage by a factor of 2.5 in order to accommodate signals approaching the ±12 V level.  Signals
within the ±80 mV set the comparator in the opposite logic state, boosting the gain from .4 to 48.  The
set point references defining the window were chosen low enough to provide adequate tolerance to
any offsets at high gain and temperature.
The latched comparator output representing the gain status is transmitted with the data as a CCL
Gain Bit.
D8 and D9 protect the comparators inputs (U16) from overvoltage. R88 prevents D8 and D9 from
clamping the CCL signal at the output of U15 and also limits the input current to the comparators."
3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 3.11 CHANNEL 13 (SP),"CHANNEL 13 (SP)
Auxiliary measurement of the SP signal, in reference to armor, is performed by this channel using an
instrument electrode, or the lower bridle electrode.  The low level SP signal must be amplified to
improve the resolution of the received signal.  Yet, the inherent offset associated with the SP can
quickly saturate the amplifier.  The practice with the surface reference SP has been to add a pot on a
panel to null out the constantly changing SP offset.
Tailored for downhole operation, the auto-offset-ranging feature of the circuit acts on the signal to
bring it within the high resolution range of the A/D (i.e. gain of 16) at all times.  The introduced offset
is one of eight defined reference voltages covering the -750 mV to +1350 mV range.  Armed with the
three-bit code (B2 B1 B0) denoting the selected value, the digitized SP can be easily reconstructed on
the surface to recover the true SP.
In a more detailed description, the noisy signal enters the circuit through an RC filter with an
overvoltage protection network (bidirectional zener diodes D3 and D4).  Common mode rejection and
buffering is carried out by U18 operating at unity gain.  The signal is filtered further by a two-pole,"

Unity gain differential amplifier (U25) functioning as a summing node, in combination with a
digital/analog feedback network, provide an offset to the filtered SP signal.  This works to keep the
output positive and to maintain it below the 600 mV threshold required for high gain.
The resistor divider network across the reference voltages ±1350 mV establish the eight signed
references in 300 mV increments.  Analog mux U21 in concert with counter U22 select one of the
eight offsets. A second voltage divider derives the band limit references +50 mV and +550 mV for the
window comparator (U20).  The comparator enables the counter to increment when the signal exceeds
550 mV or to decrement when it falls below 50 mV.  The range of the SP signal in which the
feedback control action can function is ±1.3 volts.
Of particular importance is the magnitude of the coarse 300 mV increment, because it represents a
hysteresis large enough for operating with less frequent code switching.  This minimizes any
discontinuities or spikes that could be introduced in the process.  Hopefully, the circuit searches
initially only for the correct range at the 250 KHz clock rate of the counter, and then it settles.  Note
that if the raw SP signal is close to zero, one of two possible offset codes (100 for 150 mV or 011 for
450 mV) may be generated, depending on whether the count proceeds up or down on startup.  This is
normal.
For a fast response, the control network works on the SP signal after the filtering stage."

this channel when its primary is powered with the rated 440 VRMS.  A resistor or capacitor in series
with T2 keeps the full DC voltage from being applied across T2.
For instruments requiring AC power between mode 5 center tap and 10, as in the case of RCI,

instead of 10 mVDC per 1 VRMS.  Therefore, pot P2 must be adjusted for 2.2 VDC at the channel
output when the motor voltage between conductor 10 and the center tap of T1 is 440 VRMS."

JULY 2002 4.0 CHANNEL 16 (MUD RESISTIVITY CARD) (P/N 129983-000)
The circuit utilizes an input square wave at 977 Hz for a precision reference voltage.  This square
wave is filtered by a two stage, stagger tuned, bandpass filter (U1 A and U1 B) to generate a low
harmonic content sine wave to drive the constant current amplifier.  A voltage of about 1.2 Vp-p is
applied to the primary of transformer T1. T1 provides isolation from the current driver U2.
Transformer T1 has a 1:1 turns ratio such that the 1.2 Vp-p is applied through the power amplifier to
resistor R12.  In the configuration shown, the circuit adjusts to maintain this fixed voltage drop across
R12 and in so doing provides a constant current to any load placed from the junction of T1 and R12
to ground.  R26 prevents the circuit from oscillating if E1 is directly shorted to E4.
The voltage drop across the mud column between electrodes 2 and 3 is sensed by instrumentation
amplifier U3.  The upper and lower electrodes of both E2 and E3 are bussed together internally to
obtain an average voltage drop over both the upper and lower current paths.  The high impedance
inputs on the amplifier prevent loading of the measure current in the fluid.  Capacitors C5 and C6 are
used to block any DC voltage generated in the borehole from amplifier U3.
The output from U3 is supplied to phase splitter stage U4 to drive the output isolation transformer T2.
T2 has a 1:2 turns ratio.  However, the signals add up at the center-tapped input resulting in a voltage
gain of 1.  U5 is a double pole FET switch IC which is driven by the input reference signal at 977 Hz.
The alternate opening and closing of the switches provides a full wave, synchronous detection of the
received signal.  This voltage is supplied to the A/D converter and is sent uphole as VRM."

P/N 130767-956
JULY 2002 1.0 INTRODUCTION
The 3514 XA WTS Common Remote electronics was designed with minimum adjustment
provisions to ease the calibration and maintenance procedures.  The normal checkout routine is
employed as with other downhole instruments to insure the equipment stays in good working
condition."
3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,REPAIR & MAINTENANCE - 2.0 GENERAL MAINTENANCE RECOMMENDATIONS,"Based on observations of log quality and accuracy of the signals, replacement of some parts and/or
recalibration may become necessary after demanding jobs, especially if the temperature of the
flasked electronics exceeds the recommended limit.
Normally, the tool operates reliably for 10 hours in a 200° C downhole environment assuming the
initial flask temperature was less than 30° C.  The flask temperature sensor is located at the closed
end of the flask..  When the reading is 125° C, the temperature at the open end of the flask could
be as much as 30° C higher or 150° C.  So, as a rule of thumb, a 125° C flask temperature reading
is the maximum permissible operating temperature.
Higher temperatures lead to component degradation or accelerated failure.  As such, part of good
maintenance is preventive maintenance.  The maintenance technician should feel free to remind
the engineer to adhere to the maximum temperature limitation recommended for reduced risk
operation. On reruns of deep wells or if the flask temperature was high to begin with -- due to a
previous job or instrument exposed to sunlight -- it is advisable to swap common remotes.  Where
time is short between instrument usage, it may be necessary to remove the flask and allow the heat
sinks to cool down.
As a precaution, avoid operating the instrument needlessly for extended periods of time when
inside the flask.  Internal power dissipation raises its temperature, thus reducing the available
operating time.
Perhaps these and other basic rules in the foregoing discussion may seem overemphasized.
Nevertheless, they are explicitly stated here because they are important and should not be
overlooked.
Ensure that the chassis and heat sink O-rings are in place.  These O-rings prevent damage to the
electronics due to vibration and shock.  Damage to the flask by the heavy heat sinks inside is
another concern.  The O-rings make flask installation smoother and avoid scarring the inner
surface of the flask.
When reassembling parts, always use a locking compound on the screws that hold the electronics'
mechanical sections together."
3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,REPAIR & MAINTENANCE - REPAIR/MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES,"2

3514 XA WTS COMMON REMOTE
P/N 130767-956
JULY 2002
In addition, the screws that hold the thermal isolator tube should be regularly tightened to maintain
rigidity between the flasked chassis and the power supply chassis.  Take the following precautions
when handling the electronics with the flask removed:
-
Always place the electronics on three balanced stands. Place one under each heat sink.
Place the third under the connector body of the power supply section.
-
NEVER put any stands under the transformers or other components.
-
Because the flasked section is smaller in diameter than the power supply section, support
must be given to the electronics at the heat sink end, by using a 1/4 inch thick shim board
whenever it is necessary to lay the assembly on a flat surface.  This helps alleviate stress
on the thermal isolator.
A round cable to bypass the flask is available as an accessory item for use when servicing the
electronics (see the -840 or -845 [accessory and lab equipment lists] in this manual).  Separating
part of the flat cable from the flask and using it as a bypass is not recommended.  However, if it is
done in an emergency situation, be certain to retape the flat cable precisely within the center of the
slot in the flask open-end adapter.  Due to the tight tolerance, the edge of the flat cable can be
smashed by the housing if the cable is not positioned properly.
When servicing the instrument, apply the following practices:
1.
Use the correct screw length when replacing screws.  A flat head screw would feel tight if
it bottoms out, but it would not have a firm hold on the countersunk hole.  It may also
stick out, though a small amount, to cause wear problems or scratches on the inner surface
of the flask.
2.
Use the correct screw driver i.e., with a tip width and thickness that conform to the slot
dimensions of the target screw.  Further, support the work section from below to obtain a
rigid grip and to prevent slippage.  Narrow or worn tips, incorrect use, etc., deform the slot
and leave burrs which are hazardous when handling the instrument.
3.
Secure mounting screws, larger components, and loose wires with RTV.  Reinstall
insulation sheets under PC boards to protect the wiring.  Make sure wires do not get
pinched between standoffs and PC boards.
4.
When servicing the electronics of the 3514 XA, use miniature micro-clips to connect the
scope or test equipment to the various test points.  Avoid using alligator clips which can
inadvertently short to the crowded, adjacent contacts on the boards.  Use clips with leads
shorter than 12 inches, to minimize noise pickup.  Always turn the power off before
attaching a clip to an IC lead or attaching IC test clips.
5.
All PC cards in the 3514 XA have single layer double sided PC boards with plated through
holes.  This construction simplifies debugging and board repair.  The PC boards are
densely populated, and consequently require some patience and skill when desoldering
components. Deflux the soldered area after a soldering job.  An erratically noisy signal is a
symptom of a dirty board."
3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,REPAIR & MAINTENANCE - REPAIR/MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES,"3

3514 XA WTS COMMON REMOTE
P/N 130767-956
JULY 2002
6.
After lifting the PC cards for maintenance, rearrange the crowded wires properly before
remounting.  The cards stand only 0.25 inch high above the chassis.  Assembly workers
were instructed to layout the harness in small bundles, and in such a way as to avoid the
stacking of the wires.  Do the layout in this manner while keeping the mounting hole areas
clear of any wires.  The cards must not be forced in place by merely tightening the screws.
Rather, they are to level comfortably on all spacers when lightly held in place.  If not, the
consequences are the eventual piercing of some wires by the sharp component leads.  Use
sheet insulation (F255582000) between PC boards and wires.
7.
The occasional replacement of the O-ring in the bottom sub is part of Preventive
Maintenance.  The O-ring seals the 32-pin pressure bulkhead to the housing.  Normally,
the sub is not disturbed, and requires less service.  The frequency of replacing the O-ring
has not been determined.  Log hours and other factors play a role.  Use field experience as
a guide.
Other aspects of the 3514 XA are detailed in specific components in this manual, including one
relating to its theory of operation, circuit descriptions, communication protocols, etc.  A system
checkout diagram identifies test points and other pertinent information on all four cards.  These
should prove effective in servicing the instrument when used in conjunction with the related
waveform diagrams, schematics and repair/maintenance procedures."

1 Introduction 
In performing this maintenance procedure, use the Reference Drawings and Bill of Materials, P/N 
130767-975 supplied in the manual as necessary. The checkout diagram identifies most of the test 
points on the PC cards and signal setups needed to test the instrument. Schematics and various 
waveforms are provided to help in understanding and debugging the circuits. Certain waveforms 
need not be verified or reproduced as shown in the diagrams except when troubleshooting. 
2 Mechanical Inspection 
1. Disassemble instrument and remove flask to access electronics. Observe precautions given 
in the Repair/Maintenance Procedures component, P/N 130767-956. 
2. Inspect the assemblies for loose screws on the thermal isolators, transformers, and other 
components. 
3. Inspect the wear ring/s on the heat sink. Some units have teflon tape and a Slydring. 
Replace if worn out. 
4. Inspect the bottom Airborn Connector J2 for any sockets that are not retained in the correct 
position. 
5. Ensure socketed components are firm in sockets and other components or wires are not 
broken, loose or dirty. Clean boards as necessary. 
6. Inspect the Ribbon Cable/Pigtail assembly. The inspection should include the sliding back of 
the tan mesh tubing so that visual inspection of the pigtail portion of the assembly can be 
done. This will require removal of the adapter cap F149088000, to check for insulation wear 
under the adapter cap and at the cable clamp. Refer to the figures 1 and 2 below. 
7. Replace Ribbon Cable/Pigtail assembly if older than 10 years.

supply's current does not increase with voltage. 
7. *Verify +900 ± 5 VDC between IB-11(+) and IB-12(-). 
8. Turn the DC voltage down. Push the HV OFF button. Remove AC instrument power. 
6 Repeater Checkout 
Perform the following checks on the repeater card: 
6.1 *Command Channel (Mode 2 Down) 
1. Run the TEST3510.EXE program on the 5721 test system and issue a continuous 
loopback command for the 3514. 
2. Monitor the command signal at the CMP IN terminal on the repeater card. The 
recommended signal amplitude is 8 Vp-p as depicted in Figure 8, CMD Calibration. The 
signal level may vary due to the surface equipment used (5721 or logging system) and the 
surface system's TX settings. The amplitude of the Command signal transmitted down the 
line is set depending on whether a line, a line simulator, or no line is used in the setup, as 
well as the type and length of the line and the associated voltage drop in the line or line 
simulator. For more details, refer to the 5721 or 5710 manuals. 
3. A trimpot on the 3514 repeater card, P1, is factory adjusted to yield a gain proven to allow 
successful operation in most cases. One convenient way to verify this calibration is to take a 
resistance measurement across P1, at the points indicated on the checkout diagram 
 (Figure 3). Take the measurement with the tool power off and without removing U1. The 
reading should be about 5 K. 
* Record readings on Preventive Maintenance Level 3 Checklist. The step numbers on the Checklist 
Correspond to the step numbers on the instruction portion on these pages.

4. Check the selection of R47 across R11 to center the waveform at U2-2 above and below 
ground. Use a scope vertical scale of 1 VIdiv. Ensure that the ground baseline is on top of 
the center, horizontal gridline. If adjustment is needed, use a resistance decade box to 
select the value. Use DC coupling in the scope channel's input. Install a 0.1 watt, 1% metal 
film resistor (spec 059246-000). Refer to Appendix 1 of this document for waveform pictures 
and a more detailed procedure. 
5. *Recheck that the ground baseline is still on the center horizontal gridline and that the 
positive and negative excursions of the U2-2 waveform are equal, to within 0.1 VDC of each 
other. The waveform should have a 50% duty cycle. 
6.2 *Common Remote (Mode 2 Up) 
With the program still in loopback, monitor mode 2 data up at the output of the repeater line driver 
(Test point 2-F on the checkout diagram). Verify the alternating pulses are clean with the correct 
levels of +(3 to 6)V and -(3 to 6)V. There should be no dropout. Also note any errors in the 
transmission and determine if the fault lies in the tool or is due to misadjustments in the surface 
receiver. 
6.3 *Checking Instrument Bus, Communication on Modes 2, 5, and 7 C 
At this stage, perform communication tests as outlined in the Test Systems Guide component, P/N 
130767-976, of this manual. 
6.4 Checking I.B. Modes 2, 5, And 7 C with a Signal Generator 
This option can be used if a tool simulator is not available and for troubleshooting. The test verifies 
circuit operation with a continuous tone. Therefore, it is meaningless for surface reception. 
The following steps are applicable for this procedure: 
1. Disconnect the tool simulator or any other tool that may be connected on the instrument 
bus. 
2. Terminate any surface commands. 
3. Feed a 50 kHz sinusoidal wave, not exceeding 4 Vp-p, between the M2 IBUS terminals on 
the repeater card. Monitor the signal between pins 29 and 30 of the bottom connector J2 to 
check connections. 
4. Verify the existence of the +5 V AMI pulses at BN output terminal (test point 2-F on the 
checkout diagram). 
5. Repeat the test for M5 mode, this time applying a 100 kHz signal between M5 IB terminals 
while monitoring the signal at pins 31 and 32 of J2. 
6. Verify the presence of the AMI pulses at test point 2-R5 
7. Move the same 100 kHz signal to M7 IBUS terminals. Monitor it at pins 15 and 16 of J2.

In the above tests, if any of the M2, M5 or M7 C pulses are missing, check the various clocks on this 
board. Trace back the intermediate signals, guided by the waveforms at the test points indicated on 
the checkout diagram. 
7 Testing the Analog Channels 
The analog channels can be tested using methods 1 or 2. 
7.1 Method 1: Using Simulators 
In this method, a sensors simulator box (P/N 156150) is used to simulate force, pressure (caliper), 
pressure sensor temperature, hole temperature, CCL, SP and mud resistivity. 
Method 1 is adequate but it does not check the dynamic response of the filters since only DC 
voltages are simulated. The procedure is as follows: 
1. Connect a patch box (P/N F123560000) above the simulator; power instrument; and run the 
TEXT3510.EXE program. 
 
 
 
Note 
 
With the sensors simulator connected, total tool current is 120 to 
140 mA. 
 
 
 
2. *Exercise Acquire subset F routine and verify the following: 
 
CaL LO (WCLPOS) and CaL HI (WCHPOS) 
Both = 580 mV ± 15 mV 
Zero LO+ (WZLPOS), Zero HI+ (WZHPOS),  
Zero LO- (WZLNEG), and Zero HI- (WZHNEG) 
All = 0 to 50 mV 
3. Exercise Acquire Subset 0 routine. 
4. *Verify the flask temperature reads ambient temperature. 
5. *Set the HI/ZERO/LO switch on the simulator box to HI. Allow a few acquisition cycles to 
occur while observing the % change of reading from cycle to cycle. Normally, changes 
should be within 1% or less for quiet signals. Take readings after five minutes of cycling. 
 
Tension Force 
+4 V ± .2 V or other simulated reading 
Pressure (Caliper) 
+3.3 ± .1 V or other simulated reading. 
Hole Temp. 
+200°C ± 10°C or other simulated reading 
CCL 
+42 mV ± 5 mV or other simulated reading 
6. Set the switch to LO. 
7. *Verify the following readings: 
 
Tension Force 
+4 V ± .2 V or other simulated reading 
* Record readings on Preventive Maintenance Level 3 Checklist. The step numbers on the Checklist 
Correspond to the step numbers on the instruction portion on these pages.

Pressure (Caliper) 
-1.67 V ± .1 V or other simulated reading 
Hole Temp. 
+200°C ± 10°C or other simulated reading 
CCL 
-10 V ± 1 V or other simulated reading 
8. *Set the switch to ZERO and record the offsets: 
 
Tension Force 
0mV ± 10 mV 
Pressure (Caliper) 
0 mV ± 10 mV or other simulated reading 
Hole Temp. 
0°C ± 10°C 
CCL 
0mV ± 10 mV 
 
 
 
Note 
 
The numbers may deviate from zero depending on the noise and 
offset of each channel. Compare with previous calibration records. 
 
 
9. The SP signal in the simulator uses conductor 8 as an electrode. Therefore, before taking 
this measurement, latch the Tool SP/Bridle SP relay on the controller card in the Bridle SP 
mode, using the command menu. 
10. *Check the SP circuit by advancing the switch through its 10-position settings and verify 
each reading. Indicated numerals 0-9 are for the decimal thumbwheel switch used in some 
prototype units. The production simulator box has a rotary switch. 
 
1: +1200 mV 
2: +900 mV 
3: +600 mV 
4: +300 mV 
5: ≤±10 mV offset 
6: -300 mV 
7: -600 mV 
8: -900 mV 
9: -1200 mV 
 
 
0: ≤±10 mV offset 
Accuracy of the SP values depends on the simulator calibration as well as the 3514 circuit. 
Output of the simulator itself can be checked by monitoring the input of the SP channel on 
the Sensors card between terminals SP+ and 10. Recalibrate the simulator if necessary. 
11. *Latch the analog switch (U17) in the uphole SP position by selecting Mode 7 in the 
TEST3510's command menu. Select SP position #1 (+1200 mV) on the simulator. Measure 
+1.2 ± .1 VDC between conductors 7(+) and 10(-) on the patch box (P/N 123560-000). 
Select DLL in the command menu and measure <50 mVDC. 
12. Set the tool mode to Internal CAL (for Rm CAL) using the command menu. 
13. Acquire Subset 0. 
* Record readings on Preventive Maintenance Level 3 Checklist. The step numbers on the Checklist 
Correspond to the step numbers on the instruction portion on these pages.

14. *Verify Rm CAL = 10 ± 0.1 Ωm. If not, adjust the potentiometer on the mud resistivity card 
for 10 Ωm (4.8 volts) (between the CH16 and GND terminals.) 
15. Switch the tool to internal ZERO. Acquire Subset 0. 
16. *Verify Rm ZERO = 1 Ωm ± .05 Ωm 
17. Switch the tool to LOG. Acquire subset 0. 
18. *Verify Rm LOG = 5 Ωm ± .5 Ωm or other simulated value 
7.2 Method 2: Using a Signal Generator and an Oscilloscope 
This method is for debugging purposes but can be used when no simulators are available. 
However, some channels with on board sensors can still be verified using the first method. 
 
 
 
Note 
 
In some cases, such as when calibrating the mud resistivity, mode 
switching is required. Use control features of method 1. 
 
 
Before performing this test, observe the following precautions: 
1. Any sensors or sensors simulators for the desired channels must be disconnected when 
applying a generator signal. 
2. Apply signals to the filter inputs on the Sensors card, not the output terminals or AID CH 
inputs. 
3. Do not exceed the maximum input signal levels indicated on the checkout diagram. Some 
channels have high gains. Their input stages can easily be damaged if a large signal is 
applied. Use a voltage divider if the output of your signal generator cannot be reduced within 
those limits. Take into account the offset of the generator if it cannot be nulled out. 
Refer to the checkout diagram and waveform figures at the indicated test points for testing most of 
the analog channels. The waveforms need not be reproduced exactly as shown as long as the 
timing and correct operation of the circuit is observed. 
 
 
* Record readings on Preventive Maintenance Level 3 Checklist. The step numbers on the Checklist 
Correspond to the step numbers on the instruction portion on these pages.

The cablehead voltage is useful at power-up.  The CLS system can be requested to display the
downhole AC voltage on the CRT.  Some downhole instruments can take more or less current
depending on their acquisition modes.  For example, the 1507 EA/MA Dual Phase Induction Log
tool requires more or less current, depending on the frequency of the transmitter.  If the frequency
of the transmitter is changed from one run to the next, it is necessary to readjust the surface
voltage.  The cablehead voltage reading is helpful to determine proper downhole voltage.  This
curve operates correctly only if the flask temperature is below 125° C."

The AC motor voltage can be monitored on the surface when using a 3514 CR.  The surface
current meter displays the total current that is delivered by the surface AC Motor power supply.
As the surface motor voltage increases, more current is taken by the capacitance of the wireline
conductors.  The ability to measure the downhole motor voltage helps the user determine the
proper surface voltage.  This curve operates correctly only if the flask temperature is below
125° C."

compensation.
The sensor can work under mechanical tension or compression.  In normal wireline operations,
Atlas Wireline Services are only interested in tension.  In pipe conveyed operations, the cablehead
tension curve is monitored for both tension and compression.
The total measurement range is from -12,000 lbf to +12,000 lbf.  The negative numbers
correspond to compression.  The curve can be presented in any of the standard force units: lbf
(pounds-force), N (newton), or kgf (kilograms-force).  A differential curve in units of force per
unit of the primary index is available.  Primary index is the independent variable of the acquisition,
that is depth or time.
Tension/compression sensing devices usually do not have a high absolute accuracy, but they can
have an acceptable relative accuracy.  A differential curve may give acceptable results while the
total curve may be affected by environmental conditions to the point of seriously degrading the
readings."

The borehole temperature sensor is an RTD type sensor exposed to the borehole fluids.  The
sensor does not touch the walls of the well.  A constant current circuit located in the 3514 CR
produces a voltage drop proportional to the sensor resistance.  This resistance is proportional to the
temperature of the sensing element.
The inclusion of the sensor in the 3981 XA Sub makes it possible to monitor the temperature of the
well, from top to bottom, in every run.  The inclusion of the temperature sensor in the TTRm sub
was not intended as a substitute for dedicated temperature instruments."
3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE - 6.3 MUD RESISTIVITY .....................................................................................................................6,"MUD RESISTIVITY
The mud resistivity measuring system utilizes the lateral, electrolog principal to determine the
resistivity of the fluid within a radius of approximately 3 inches of the center line of the tool.  A
constant current is generated within the tool and is passed from the center electrode in the array
(E1),  to an upper and lower return section of the housing.  Two voltage sensing electrodes (E2,
E3, inner and outer) are used to sense the voltage drop within the fluid due to the current being
emitted from the center electrode.
The current flow is restricted to the borehole (the mud) for borehole sizes of 6 inches and larger
because the return electrodes for the current are only 0.625 of an inch away from the source.
Calculations have shown that for borehole sizes of 8 inches or more, the apparent resistivity is
within 90% of the actual resistivity for Rt/Rm contrasts of from 0.1 to 10,000."

The conventional SP is measured between a surface electrode and a downhole electrode.  On some
offshore jobs, the noise on the SP curve may be unacceptably large.  In some of these cases a
better quality SP log can be obtained by measuring the SP between two downhole electrodes.  This
measurement could be made from the surface using two wireline conductors or made downhole by
one of the tools.  The 3514 CR has the capability of acquiring the SP curve downhole.  Cable
armor is used as one electrode and the other electrode is usually on a tool. In some cases, the lower
electrode on the bridle is substituted for the tool electrode.
Simultaneous acquisition of Downhole SP and conventional SP is possible."

JULY 2002
1.0 3514 XA WTS COMMON REMOTE FUNCTIONS
The primary function of the 3514 CR is to act as a repeater of the telemetry channels and to create
the WTS Instrument Bus (WTS-IB).  The 3514 CR does not interpret or take any action with
commands that are targeted to other instruments of the tool string.  This is also true for the data
that is sent to the surface from the tools.
A secondary function is to acquire data from several sensors located in its electronic cartridge and
outside of it.
2.0 3514 XA WTS COMMON REMOTE HARDWARE
The 3514 CR is a flasked instrument designed for operation at 400° F (204°C) for 10 hours.  It is
over six feet long, 3-5/8 inches in diameter and runs on 180 VAC, 60 Hz.
There are four printed circuit cards inside the flask.  In addition, a DC voltage regulator card is
mounted in the non-flasked power supply section.  Three transformers, used to drive the line, are
also located outside the flask.  The circuit cards inside the flask are:
-
The Acquisition and Control card.
-
The Repeater card.
-
The Sensors card.
-
The Mud Resistivity card.
The system is based on a 6805 type Motorola processor.  It controls the acquisition of the data
curves.  The processor does not take any active role in the communications with the surface panel
or the other instruments in the tool string.
The acquisition section sends six zero and calibration values to the surface with the periodicity
dictated by the surface software.  These calibration and zero values are derived from a precision
reference supply and insure a continuous compensation for offset changes due to temperature and
aging."

In a multiconductor cable WTS uses modes as communication channels.  Modes are special
conductor configurations that have better communication characteristics than random pairs of
conductors.  There are seven modes in a 7-conductor wireline cable but the WTS System uses only
4 of them.  The ECLIPS system communicates with WTS tools in the tool string through three
digital telemetry channels.
Modes are labeled with numbers in increasing order of wave propagation velocity.  Mode 1 is the
slowest and mode 7 is the fastest.  Modes used by the WTS are shown in the table below:

P/N 130767-936
JULY 2002 4.0 WIRELINE COMMUNICATIONS
The surface panel is responsible for driving the line and receiving the data from the tools.  The
wireline attenuates the digital signals.  The higher frequency components of the digital signals are
more attenuated than the lower frequency components of the signal.  The digital signal traveling
from the downhole instruments is amplified and equalized in the surface panel.  The equalization
consists of emphasizing the amplitude of the high frequency components.
The WTS telemetry system in a multiconductor environment requires a 3514 CR.  All the WTS
compatible instruments are required to reside below the 3514 CR in the tool string.  The WTS
compatible instruments cannot communicate to the surface by themselves.  Analog signals from a
TTRm sub, caliper, and/or a CCL, above the 3514, are digitized in the CR.
Mode 2 is bi-directional and half duplex. It is used either as a command channel to send
commands from the surface panel to the tools, or to send data from the tools to the surface.  When
used to send commands to the tools, the bit rate is 20.83 kilobits per second (kbps).  When the
channel is used by the tools to send data to the surface the rate is 41.66 kbps.
The other two telemetry channels, modes 5 and 7, are simplex and used as data channels only.
The data rate for these channels is 93.75 kbps.  Modes 2, 5 and 7 can be used simultaneously.
Manchester code is used to send commands to the tools, and to send data from the tools to the
surface.  Mode 2 uses fixed-length 16-bit words, while modes 5 and 7 use variable length streams
of bits.  The transmission overhead of mode 2 is 4 bits out of 20, while the mode 5 and mode 7
overhead is equal to 11 bits, regardless of the length of the block of bits being transmitted.
Mode 5 and mode 7 are ideal to send large volumes of data in large blocks, both for their intrinsic
high bit rate and for its reduced overhead.
The encoder/decoder used for mode 2 has a parity bit included in the overhead while modes 5 and
7 do not have any built-in error detection.
The WTS software flags the host computer when the data being received is not valid.  The data is
not valid if there is a communication error.  The WTS software does not make any interpretation of
the data received from the downhole instruments.  The instruments are not requested to retransmit
if there are communication errors.
Up to 20 channels of data can be acquired and transmitted by the 3514 CR including 6 calibration
channels.  The data is grouped into 9 subsets that can be requested by the host depending on the
service required and system level of the surface equipment.  For example, systems that do not
support multiple sampling rates can use the subsets that include the calibration channels in their
repertoire.
Some of the signals are available as standard measurements in the 3514 CR.  Others rely on
optional subs that must be placed above the 3514 CR in the tool string."

3514 XA WTS COMMON REMOTE
P/N 130767-995
JULY 2002 1.0 ACQUISITION SYSTEM
The 3514 CR acquires signals generated inside and outside of its housing.  All signals are filtered
before being converted to digital.  The cutoff frequencies of these filters are different, depending
on the expected maximum sampling rate for the particular curve and its frequency contents.
The acquisition system consists of a 12 bit A/D converter with a 0 to 10 VDC input range.  An
inverter circuit before the A/D converter adjusts for negative signals.  It makes the system a 13-bit
equivalent converter.  For expanded dynamic range the analog signals are multiplied by a factor of
2 or 16, depending on the magnitude of the signals.  The CCL signal passes through an extra gain
ranging system of 0.4 or 48 times, for more dynamic range.  The downhole SP circuit has an
automatic offset system in order to improve its dynamic range.
In order to cancel out the effects of drifts in the analog circuitry, the input of the A/D associated
circuitry is periodically shorted and the drift measured, at different gains.  The values are sent to
the surface as data items.  The surface software compensates for the drift.  A precision reference of
580 mV is also used as an input to the A/D system to measure the changes in total gain and
compensate for them.  Depending on the acquisition mode (subset being acquired), the correction
in the surface can take place at each sampled level or less often."

contains relays which can disconnect the HVDC from the instrument bus below it (to protect a
1970 RCI if run below the MRIL).
The 3981 TTRm sub, 2330 CCL, and 4209 caliper (switch position 3) do not connect to the WTS

ports."
3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,COMBINATION LOGGING PROCEDURES - 2.0 COMPATIBILITY OF WTS TOOLS WITH NON-WTS TOOLS,"Generally speaking there are two ways to combine old and new technology logging instruments.
One is to use a 3516 Slam Adapter and the other is to use a 3517 Modal Adapter and a 3514 CR
with a modified top connector (M2 block).
The 3516 Slam Adapter has a WTS interface looking up and a 3506 PCM interface looking down.
This arrangement allows WTS tools to be positioned above the 3516 Slam Adapter and tools
compatible with the 3506 PCM to be positioned below the 3516 Slam Adapter.
Using a 3517 Modal Adapter and a 3514 CR with an M2 block allows old technology instruments
to be run above some WTS instruments.
Caliper signals placed between the center tap of the power transformer and armor are recovered in
the surface acquisition system.

WTS INSTRUMENT BUS USAGE
1.2.1
TELEMETRY CHANNELS
The WTS Common Remote instrument is the top instrument of a WTS tool string.  It is the one
that creates the WTS Instrument Bus.  The instrument uses Mode 2 Command and Mode 2 Data.
It does not use Mode 5 and Mode 7.
When relay K1 is in the ""AC MTR"" position, conductor 7 and the Mode 7 output are disconnected
However, the ""Mode 7"" position of K1 allows rhe use of Mode 7 while DC motor power is
applied.  This is an improvement in capability compared to the 3510 Common Remote.
When an instrument that requires a surface electrode is in the string, the wireline conductor #7 is
connected to pin #13 of the 32-pin I.B. connector through the Mode 7 blocking choke L4.  The
line connected to pin #13 is used to provide surface reference to some resistivity instruments, such
as Dual Laterolog.
1.2.2
ELECTRODE LINES
SP is read downhole.  If a DLL surface reference is not required, SP can be connected through L4
to wireline #7  In this configuration, SP can also be measured at the surface.
This instrument can use the Spontaneous Potential line (pin #14 of the 32-pin black block
connector) .  Or, if the service requires an SP to be acquired and there is no tool with an SP
electrode in the string, then a latching relay can be switched so that the SP can be measured from
the bottom bridle electrode.  In this case, the bottom bridle electrode line is disconnected from pin
#8 of the 32-pin connector.
1.2.3
ARMOR
The housing of the 3514 instrument is not directly connected to armor, but it is used as an
electrode for the Mud Resistivity sub-system, when a TTRmSM sub is in the tool string.  The
housing of the 3514 is not isolated from the top and bottom subs, however.
1.2.4
RESISTIVITY SYNCH LINE
This line (I.B. 17) is connected to Mode 5 CT and I.B. 12, and is used for AC MTR and -DC
MTR.  I.B. 17 provides extra current carrying capacity for AC motor power.
1.2.5
POWER LINES
The primary of the power transformer is connected to wireline conductors 1 and 4, which are also
connected to pins 1 and 4 of the 32-pin connector.  When top block #2 is installed in the 3514, the
center tap of the primary of this transformer is connected to pin 11 of the 32-pin bottom connector.
When top block #1 is installed in the 3514, the centertap of the primary coil in the 4430 XB is
connected to pin 11 of the 32-pin bottom connector of the 3514.  This scheme separates the DC
power from AC instrument power below the 4430 XB.  This is required when running the RCI
with MRIL.  For more information, refer to FMN 98-10, which converts a 4430 XA to a 4430 XB.
I.B. 11 is used to provide motoring power to DC motors of other tools in the tool string, as well
high voltage DC to the NMR tool.  The return of the motoring current is on the centertap of Mode
5 (wireline conductors 2, 3, 5 and 6).  Mode 5 centertap is connected to pins 12 and 17 of the 32-
pin connector.  These lines also carry AC motor power.  AC motor current returns on armor, via
pins 9 and 10 of the 32-pin connector."

WXYZ MMMM MMMM MMMM
Where:
M (12 bits), is the magnitude of the converted analog signal.
Z is the A/D Gain Bit.
The A/D conversion system has an automatic gain of either 2 or 16. This is valid for all curves.  If
the gain bit (shown as Z) is 0, a gain of 2 was used by the A/D.  If the gain bit is 1, a gain of 16
was used by the A/D.  The automatic gain adds 18 dB of dynamic gain to the system.
Y is the A/D sign bit.
The system also has the capability of inverting the analog signal before it sends it to the A/D.  If
the sign bit is 1, the sign of the magnitude is positive.  If the sign bit is 0, the sign of the magnitude
is negative.  The sign bit adds 6 dB of dynamic range to the system.
2.1.1
CCL CASE
The CCL circuitry has another automatic gain of either 0.4 or 48, in addition to the A/D gain of 2

and negative.
2.2.2
CCL FORMULAS
For CCL the formulas are:
Correct_Reading(mV) = 580 mV/CCLG*[(RL+)-(WZLP)]/[(WCLP)-(WZLP)]
Correct_Reading(mV) = 580 mV/CCLG*[(RH+)-(WZHP)]/[(WCHP)-(WZHP)]
Correct_Reading(mV) = -580 mV/CCLG*[(RL-)-(WZLN)]/[(WCLP)-(WZLP)]
Correct_Reading(mV) = -580 mV/CCLG*[(RH-)-(WZHN)]/[(WCHP)-(WZHP)]
CCLG is the CCL gain. If bit X = 0, then CCLG = 0.4.
If bit X = 1, then CCLG = 48.
2.2.3
SPONTANEOUS POTENTIAL CASE
For SP there is only one formula because it is acquired always with a gain of 16 and with the
implicit sign bit = 1 (positive).
Correct_Reading(mV) = 580 mV*[(RH+)-|(WZHP)|]/[(WCHP)-|(WZHP)|] - SPOFST
SPOFST is calculated as follows:

3514XAXB-TMTY-AMO,INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS - 3.4 MOTORING COMMANDS .......................................................................................................11,"MOTORING COMMANDS
This tool does not have a motor.  The AC and DC motoring condutors are hardwired and donot
need relay switching in the 3514 to complete the circuits.  If the tool power is turned off, the tool
will re-initialize itself.  Refer to Section 3.1 for the defaults of the tool at power-up.
DC motoring can be performed while communicating on ""True Mode 7"" (M7 C).
Assume that a tool with WTS address hex 99 is to be opened, and that the tool does not require a
parameter.  The following is the required sequence of commands and tests:
Exit AC Motor Mode (C)8004+(W)0014
ACTION
COMMAND/DATA STRING
--------------------------------
--------------------------------------
Force all instruments in the
tool string to exit motor mode:
All instruments exit motor mode (C)0004+(W)0014
Open Tool(C)9905+(D)0000+(W)0014
Check status of tool:
Tool Send Motor Status(C)990 F+(D)0001
The tool should send the word[D]0001
Increase motor supply voltage and
hold  it until the motoring action
is complete.
Check status of tool:
Tool Exit Motor Mode(C)9904+(W)0014
Tool Send Motor Status(C)990 F+(D)0001
The tool should send the word[D]0000
The procedure for closing is the same as the one described above, except that all the OPEN
commands are changed to CLOSE commands.
NOTE: Before applying AC Motor Power (RCI), perform the sequence
(C)8000 + (D)0000 + (W) 0014 to open wireline conductor 7.  Then, request the status word with
(C)800 F + (D)0001.  The 3514 should send the word [D]0001.  When AC motoring is completed,
turn down the AC power and perform the sequence (C)8004 + (W)0014 to reconnect to wireline
conductor 7.  Check the status of the 3514 with (C)800 F + (D)0001 - it should send [D]0000."

or
(Command Synch) Motor Close (DC Motor)

(Data Synch) parameter
0000
The WTS Common Remote does not have a motor. Any of the two commands above set the
non-latching relay AC Motor/Mode 7 of the Common Remote to the AC Motor State (default at
power-up).
In the 3514, the AC and DC motoring conductors are hardwired, without requiring switching
relays to complete the motoring circuits.  Either of these commands could be used to prepare the
3514 for RCI operations.  Either command will disconnect the Mode 7 signal path and the uphole
SP path or LL return path from wireline conductor 7.  See additional comments under command
8000.
(Command Synch) Internal Zero
8007 & 0007
The instrument switches to Internal Zero state (only for Mud Resistivity).
(Command Synch) Internal Cal
8008 & 0008
The instrument switches to Internal Cal state (only for Mud Resistivity).
(Command Synch) Log
8009 & 0009
The instrument switches to Mud Resistivity Log state (default at power-up).
(Command Synch) Tool SP
8080
When this command is executed, the latching relay Tool SP/Bridle SP is set to Tool SP.  This is
the default state at power-up. In the default state, SP is allowed to come from any instrument
below the Common Remote connected to the SP line.  Also, the lower bridle electrode will be
routed to pin #8 of the lower 32-pin instrument bus connector in the 3514.
(Command Synch) Bridle SP
8081
When this command is executed, the latching relay Tool SP/Bridle SP is set to the Bridle SP state.
In this case, the lower bridle electrode is disconnected from pin #8 of 32-pin instrument bus
connector.  If there is an instrument in the string that uses the Lower Bridle Electrode, the Tool
SP/Bridle SP relay has to be in the Tool SP position.   The 3514 measures downhole SP versus
armor (conductor 10).
(Command Synch) Uphole SP
8082
When this command is executed, an analog switch connects the selected SP signal through a choke
to Mode 7/AC MTR relay.  This is the default at power-up.
(Command Synch) DLL
8083
When this command is executed, an analog switch connects the DLL  (HDLL) line of the
instrument bus through a choke to the Mode 7/AC MTR relay.  Command 8004 must also be sent"

SP (mV) = Corrected_Reading_SP - SPOFST
For convenience, the offset formula given above is tabulated below for all states of the binary code
XYZ.
The rationale for choosing the offset range would not be apparent without the following desirable
results:
At the lowest end of the SP signal range, SPOFST would be: +50 mV -1350 mV = -1300 mV.
At the highest end: +550 mV + 750 mV = +1300 mV.
The total SP range is then +/- 1300 mV.

The SP offset is assumed to be exact, that is, it needs no correction.  The SP offset adds dynamic
range to the SP subsystem, with the same resolution over the overall range.  It is added downhole
to the Spontaneous Potential signal before the X16 gain stage, to limit the swing of the signal
between +50 mV and +550 mV."

The following formulas are used, depending on the sign and gain bits of the curve:
If the sign bit is 1 (positive), and the gain bit is 0
(gain = 2):
Correct_Reading(mV) = 580 mV * [(RL+) - (WZLP)] / [(WCLP) - (WZLP)]
If the sign bit is 1 (positive), and the gain bit is 1
(gain = 16):
Correct_Reading(mV) = 580 mV * [(RH+) - (WZHP)] / [(WCHP) - (WZHP)]
If the sign bit is 0 (negative), and the gain bit is 0
(gain = 2):
Correct_Reading(mV) = -580 mV * [(RL-) - (WZLN)] / [(WCLP) - (WZLP)]
If the sign bit is 0 (negative), and the gain bit is 1
(gain = 16):
Correct_Reading(mV) = -580 mV * [(RH-) - (WZHN)] / [(WCHP) - (WZHP)]
All the values in the above formulas are the values received from the tool, ANDed with (hex)
0 FFF to mask off the high order nibble, and floated before use.  580 mV is a tool internal
reference value.
The preceding formulas are used for:
-Flask Temperature
-Cablehead Tension
-Caliper *
-Borehole Temperature
-Cablehead Voltage
-Motor Voltage
-Mud Resistivity
* - note: in addition to the above formulas, the Caliper ""correct reading (mV)"" must be
multiplied by a factor of three, to compensate for the circuit's voltage divider.
The additive and multiplicative factors to convert to Engineering Units are to be applied after the
raw values are corrected as indicated above."

Using a dummy or actual line, connect the electronics to the WTS Analog Test Panel operating
with a PC and the TEST3510.EXE program or other updated versions.  (see the Preventive
Maintenance Level 3 document, Figure 953-1, Setup for Testing 3514 Common Remote).
Use a 28 pin patch box (F123560000) to insert a true RMS current meter (Fluke 87 DMM) in
series with conductor 1 at the top of the 3514.
Power-up the instrument with Instrument Power using a voltmeter to measure 180 VAC at the
cablehead.  Verify current is 80 to 110 mA (100 to 140 mA above the sensors simulator box,
F156150000).
Verify communication by exercising the loopback command.  Common Remote errors produce
audible tones in the PC when the sound option is enabled.
Verify correct data acquisition operation by acquiring some subsets and monitoring various data
channels of signals originating inside the Common Remote.
If using a classic ECLIPS system instead of the PC, run the 3514 software program WTSCOM to
verify the above responses.
If using ECLIPS-S, from the Acquisition menu, select ""Communication Utilities"".  Then select the
RAP card and ""Multiple Telemetry Setcom"".  In the pop-up menu, select the telemetry type you
want to test, and select the tool (3514).  Other selections are GAIN SET; and then TRAIN, or LCP
(to set LCP relays).
OCT's were developed to request subset E from the tools and display the received data, compared
to the expected data. One of these OCT's  should be used to verify the data coming back is correct.
There are two OCT's which can display the subset E data:  _894 A1 and _894 T.  Probably _894 A
gets the most use.

1. Edit _894 A to correspond to the string you have connected.
2. Start the OCT.
3. Open the all.show display, and scroll down to see the subset E curves.
4. The curves are grouped by tool address.

For mode 2, the data will be displayed as E2 C1.xx through E2 C8.xx, where xx is the tool address
(Common Remote address = 80; Spectralog = 08; HDIL = 15; Acoustic = 03; etc.)
The STM2.xx curve displays the checksum status of E2 C2.xx through E2 C8.xx.  E2 C1.xx is not
included in the checksum.  If the checksum is correct, STM2.xx = 0.  If there is an error in the
returned subset E data, STM2.xx = 1.


1 The _ denotes the letter identifier (e, f, g, etc.) for the current ECLIPS database revision, and will
vary according to the current ECLIPS release."

For mode 7, the data will be displayed as E7 C1.xx through E7 C17.xx, with checksum status
curve STM7.xx.

If the system recognizes a tool as not containing a M5 or M7 line driver, M5 or M7 curves will not
be displayed.

If there are a lot of tools in the string, the Spectralog's data for E2 C1 might be displayed as 08yy,
where yy is the address of the tool connected below the 1329.  For example, 0815 could be
displayed, if an HDIL is connected below the Spectralog.  The data sent from the 1329 should be
0808.  This is a WTS bug.  E2 C1.xx is not included in the checksum.

NVM only checks that the words are in valid Manchester format.  NVM does not check that the
data is correct.  The value of -894 A is that it checks that the data received matches the data the tool
is supposed to send, for each enabled mode."

Communication on modes 2, 5, and 7 C can be checked either by operating an actual WTS tool
string that transmits on these modes, or by using a tool simulator.  The latter assumes using a PC.
In the first case, if using the WTS system, run the corresponding services and verify correct
reception.
In the second case, connect the Tool Simulator to the bottom connector of the Common Remote.
Select the option Tool Simulator from the menu of the TEST3510.EXE PC software.  Run
Acquire Subset 0.
The simulator is exercised in a background cycle during the 3514 data acquisition loop.  Errors
produce audible clicks.  Note that for Mode 7 C to function, two settings must be in the correct
position to route the signal.  The required Mode 7 C settings are as follows:
1.
The motor switch of the Analog Test Panel must be in the NO MOTOR position.
2.
Relay K1 in the Common Remote must be set in EXIT mode.
Verify the above settings noting that the last K1 setting should be indicated on the status line of the
Acquire Menu.  If incorrect, hit the Enter key to bring up the command window.  Select EXIT
mode and hit ENTER again, or the EXIT key, to continue acquiring.
Hit the space bar to observe communication on Modes 2, 5, and 7 C and any communication errors.
Isolate and correct any problems.
Verify the switching of relay K1 by changing the command from EXIT mode to MOTOR mode.
Conductor 7 becomes disconnected from the mode 7 C channel causing communication on this
mode to cease.
Restore mode 7 C communication by switching back to EXIT mode.
For more extensive testing of these modes and faster repetition rates, the software program

P/N 130767-976
JULY 2002 3.0 TESTING THE ANALOG CHANNELS
The analog channels can be tested by acquiring certain subsets and verifying the readings for
expected values, tolerances, and noise levels.
Channels with sensors that connect to the Upper Bus of the Common Remote require the use of
these devices in a controlled environment, or the use of a sensors simulator box (P/N 156150). The
box is used to simulate force, caliper, hole temperature, CCL, SP and mud resistivity.
Other channels measured inside the Common Remote such as the six calibration values, flask
temperature, cablehead voltage, motor voltage, internal zero, and cal values for the mud resistivity
can all be verified directly.
These tests can best be performed by using the exhaustive method given in the Preventive
Maintenance Level 3 document in this manual.  (see section 7.1 Method 1: Using Simulators).
However, the following simplified procedure is adequate for this section:
Connect a patch box (F 123560000) above the simulator, power instrument; and run the Common
Remote test program if using a PC.
Exercise Acquire subset F routine and verify the following:
A/D CAL HI (WCHPOS) and CAL LO (WCLPOS) values = 580 mV + 15 mV.
All four A/D Zero Reference (WZxxxx) values are within 50 mV.
Exercise Acquire Subset 0 routine.
Verify the Flask Temperature reads ambient temperature.
Verify the Cablehead Voltage reads the value applied to tool.
CAUTION
DO NOT USE THE ANALOG TEST PANEL TO VERIFY THE MOTOR VOLTAGE
CHANNEL READING.
The 5721 analog test panel applies AC motor voltage on AC-centertap vs. 10, whereas the 3514
expects AC motor voltage on Mode 5-centertap vs 10.  Use an ECLIPS system to verify the AC
motor voltage channel reading as follows:
Verify the ECLIPS software is Release 3.0 Update 3 or later.
If a 4430 XB power sub is being used, install block #1 at the top of the 3514.  If a 4430 XB
is not in the string, use block #2."

The power supply uses a half-bridge switching power supply topology to convert a
nominal 250 Vdc to 28 Vdc. The half-bridge topology (see Figure 2) consists of two
alternately-conducting MOSFETs (Q1, Q2), input energy storage capacitors (C11, C14),
switched mode power transformer (T1), rectifier diodes (D1, D3), switched mode choke
(L1), and output filter capacitors (C1, C2).

conduction time (ton) of MOSFETs Q1 and Q2, which are switching at a frequency of
120 kHz (1/T). A closed loop feedback system compares Eo to a reference voltage and
adjusts the MOSFETs conduction time (ton) to maintain a constant output voltage (Eo).
For example, as Ein increases, ton decreases proportionally to maintain a constant Eo.
Mathematically, this can be written as:

Ein
Np
Ns
T
ton
Eo

Where:

Ein is the nominal 250-Vdc input voltage to the Power Supply

Ns/Np is the turns ratio of power transformers T1

1/T is the 120 kHz switching frequency

ton is the MOSFET’s conduction time

Eo is the regulated 28 Vdc output

Tracing through one cycle of operation, assume Q1 has been biased off and Q2 on.
Current flows from C14 through T1, C12, and Q2, applying 1/2 Ein across the primary
(Np) of T1. This primary voltage pulse is inductively coupled to the secondary winding
(Ns) of T1. The coupled secondary voltage forward biases diode D1, permitting
secondary current to flow through C1 and C2 and returning through L1 to the secondary
center tap of T1.
The conduction period ends when the conducting MOSFET (Q2) is commanded off, but
L1 ensures that current continue to flow to the load. Secondary current continues to flow
since the current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously. This is referred to as
the “freewheeling” period, which is the interval inductor L1 maintains the load current
until the opposite MOSFET begins conducting. Current flows from L1, through D1, D3
and returns through C1 and C2 during the “freewheeling” period.
When the opposite MOSFET (Q1) is commanded on, the “freewheeling” period ends, D3
is now forward biased, D1 is reverse biased, and current flows through C1, C2 again,
returning through L1 to the secondary center tap of T1.
The cycle repeats with the next “freewheeling” period followed by Q2 being commanded
on again. The MOSFET’s conduction time is controlled by the feedback circuitry to
maintain a constant 28-Vdc output in spite of the varying load and Ein.

Voltage mode PWM (Pulse Width Modulator) Controller U1 provides the nucleus for the
converter control circuitry. U1 provides the building blocks for the control circuitry that
consists of an error amplifiers, clock, PWM circuitry, and shutdown circuitry.
Converter switching frequency is set by the PWM’s clock, which operates at twice the
switching frequency. Components R16, C19, and C20 set the oscillator frequency and
dead time. The PWM’s Sync signal (pin 10) is used on the Output Filter PCB. U8 and
U9 A buffer the signal (CLKOUT) before it is transformer (T3) coupled to the Output
Filter PCB.
Control of the MOSFET conduction time is accomplished with PWM circuitry internal to
U1. The PWM circuitry functions by comparing the error voltage at U1, pin 5 with a
ramp signal synchronized with the PWM’s clock. Q3 buffers the ramp signal, which is
then applied to U1, pin 4. The PWM circuitry provides a duty cycle modulated waveform
that is alternately directed to DrvA and DrvB. Figure 4 shows the PWM (U1) waveforms.

Soft start (SS) is a controlled start-up process that reduces stress on the Power Supply
components and minimizes output overshoot during start-up. Soft start is accomplished
by controlling the rate at which the voltage on pin 1 (C/S SS) of the PWM IC ramps-up,
which in turn controls Vout’s rise time. The controlled start-up is provided by the time
constant provided by R53 and C62. The voltage across C62 is buffered by U11 and drives
the PWM’s C/S SS pin. Note that the 28 volt output takes ~160 ms to reach full output.
PSEN = 1, Run goes high and turns off Q5 and Q8, which allows the voltage on C62 to
start increasing exponentially, allowing Vout to start ramping up. Comparator-generated
signals SSRST/ and SSCMP indicate SS status. Signal SSRST/ is low when C62 is fully
discharged and conversely SSCMP=1 when SS is complete. These signals control the SS
process when HCL (high current limit) goes high. Under a sustained HCL condition, SS
is invoked and the signals force each SS cycle to terminate before the next cycle starts.

Sense+ and Sense- lines. Choke T2 provides common-mode filtering and the
demodulated error voltage is buffered by a differential amplifier consisting of U3 and
associated components. The buffered error voltage (VERROR) is applied through and an
RC network to pin 5 (E/A+) of the PWM U1. Internal to U1, the error voltage is
compared to the voltage ramp on U6, pins 4. This comparison produces the ton pulse that
is alternately connected to A Out or B Out of U1. As previously discussed, a change in
Eo is detected by the control-loop circuitry and the circuit adjusts ton proportionately to
correct Eo. Refer to Figure 4 and Figure 7.

Refer to Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10 during this discussion. Current transformer T4
samples the current pulses, delivered by Q1 and Q2 to the primary of transformer T1 to
provide over-current protection. The primary current is used to detect output overload
conditions since the primary current is equal to the secondary current reflected by Np/Ns.
Components R22, D3, and D4 convert the bipolar current pulse to a unipolar voltage
pulse. Components R21, R23, C71 and C21 serve to divide and filter the signal prior to
application to U7 and U13, which are the over current detection comparators. Transistor
Q4, IC U6, and associated components blank the leading edge current spike, on R22, to

RC snubbers (R1 – R3, R5, R28, R29, C11, C18, and C35) across each rectifier diode and
transformer secondary dampen rectifier turn-on ringing, which is caused by the resonance
of the rectifier’s junction capacitance and the transformer’s secondary leakage
inductance. 

HOUSEKEEPING POWER SUPPLY
The housekeeping power supply (HKPS) is a two transistor Flyback Switching Power
Supply that is controlled by a Si9120 PWM IC. Operation is similar to the previously
discussed PWM circuitry in that the MOSFET’s conduction time is modulated to
maintain a constant output voltage.
The voltage ramp required for PWM is provided by capacitor C53 charging through
resistors R45 and R59. Diode D16 serves to reset the ramp after each cycle. Output over-
current protection is provided via resistor R13 and diode D20.
For regulation purposes, the 15 Vdc is fed back through R12 and R17; with C21, C25,
and R11 setting the loop gain.
Resistor R6 sets the PWM’s switching frequency to 200 kHz, while resistor R16
establishes the PWM’s bias current. The PWM’s pin-5 output drives the two MOSFETs
concurrently, each through its own DC restoration circuit (C23, D19, R56, C17, D13, and
R53). Energy is stored in the air gap of T1 while transistors Q2 and Q1 are conducting.
During the conduction interval, diode D1 is reverse biased. When Q1 and Q2 are turned
off, energy stored in T1 is released, D1 is forward biased, and the output capacitors (C6-
C15, C46, and C47) are charged. During the conduction interval, when D1 is reverse-
biased, energy stored in the output capacitors maintains the 15-Vdc output.
Start-up power is provided to the PWM through diode D12 and resistor R3. Once the
HKPS commences operation, PWM operating power is supplied from the 15-Vdc output
via components D4, R45, D5, D9, and D10.

MICRO-COMPUTER CONTROLLER
The PIC16 F873, U5, is an 8-bit microcontroller with an internal 10-bit A/D and data
EEPROM. Chip U6 and related components translate CHV to a 0 Vdc to 5 Vdc signal
(ACHV) that is compatible with U5. Likewise, U10 and related components translate
temperature dependent current from the chassis-mounted AD590 to a signal (ATEMP)
that is compatible with U5. Chip U8 permits monitoring of the 15-Vdc supplied by the
HKPS.
Power Supply Enable (PSEN) and Over Current reset (OCR) are output command lines
to the Controller PCB. A logic high from PSEN turns on the 28-Vdc output and OCR
resets a latch internal to U16 on the Controller PCB.
Latched output under voltage (LOUV), latched output over-voltage (LOOV), and latched
over current (LOC) are 28-Vdc output status signals sent back from U16 on the
Controller PCB. The status of these signals is saved in the microcontroller’s EEPROM
for diagnostic purposes.
130961-945 / 3518 FB

3518 FB Telemetry Power Section Instrument – Circuit Descriptions
The microcontroller monitors cable-head voltage, chassis temperature, and housekeeping
voltage to ensure these parameters are within limits before enabling the 28 Vdc power
supply. Once the 28 Vdc power supply has been enabled, the microcontroller continues
monitoring the three parameters and will disable the power supply if any fall out-of-
range.
The typical ON/OFF set points determined by the microcontroller are:
•
Cablehead voltage set points:
�
Turn – ON:
Vch >225 Vdc or < 300 Vdc
�
Turn – OFF:
Vch < 160 Vdc or > 330 Vdc
•
Over-Temperature set points are as follows:
�
Power Supply OFF: Chassis temperature equal or greater than 175º C
�
Power Supply ON:
Chassis temperature 170º C or less
•
Vcc set points
�
Power Supply ON: 14.5 Vdc – 15.5 Vdc
When the cable-head voltage or chassis temperature goes out of range, the
microcontroller disables the power supply and waits for these conditions to fall within
range again before restarting the power supply. The microcontroller behaves slightly
differently to Vcc. If Vcc drifts out of range while the power supply has been enabled, the
PIC will permanently disable the power supply. In this situation, the microcontroller must
be reset by cycling the housekeeping voltage (i.e., lower the cablehead voltage below 150
Vac).
The PIC board monitors three power supply status signals (LOC, LOUV, LOOV) while
the 28 Vdc power supply is enabled. The PIC will record any change in the state of these
signals in its internal EEPROM. The PIC board will permanently disable the power
supply if the LOOV signal is asserted, indicating an over-voltage condition on the 28-
Vdc bus. Similar to a Vcc out-of-range condition, the microcontroller must be reset to
exit this condition.
LED D14 provides an indication of the microcontroller’s state. The LED blinks at a rate
of twice per second when the microcontroller is holding the 28 Vdc power supply off and
waiting for cablehead voltage, chassis temperature, and Vcc to fall in range. Once the 28
Vdc power supply has been turned on, the PIC will leave the LED on continuously. The
LED will blink at a rate of once per second when the PIC permanently disables the power
supply in the event of a Vcc out-of-range or assertion of LOOV.
Jumper JP1 is a 10-pin header used to connect the PIC board to a PC for diagnostic
purposes. Four shunts are installed across the jumper when the diagnostic port is not in
use.
P3 is a header used for in-circuit programming and debugging. J2 is a jumper with a
shunt that is removed only during in-circuit programming of the microcontroller. The
shunt needs to be installed for normal board operation.

4.0 amps, maximum, to the toolstring from a DC cable-head voltage (CHV) of 160 Vdc to
330 Vdc. However, a CHV of 225 Vdc is required to start the power supply to ensure the
CHV does not drop below 160 Vdc, due to the voltage drop in the cable as the power supply
comes up.

3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Training Supplement - 1.0 SERVICE OVERVIEW,"SERVICE OVERVIEW

The 3518 Focus Telemetry is a communications device for the Focus downhole
system.  This is a combination instrument comprised of the 3518 FB, the power
module, the 3518 EB, the communications module and the 3518 EG, the Gamma
Ray module.

The 3518 FB, the power module, converts a nominal wireline 250 VDC voltage to
+28 VDC as part of the Matrix1 Instrument Bus (MIB).  +28 VDC is generated to
provide power for instrument electronics and motors.  For more details, see
manual 130961-915.

The primary role of the 3518 EB module is to serve as a communications bridge
between the wireline and the MIB.  To do this, the Focus Telemetry accepts
surface commands in the AMI format.  The Telemetry determines if the received
word is valid, and if so, the entire word is regenerated in Manchester UDI format
and sent out on the MIB.  Focus instruments connected to the MIB are
responsible for their own interpretation and response to the Manchester signal.
Conversely, instrument data sent back to the surface is received by the
Telemetry and converted to AMI pulse format before being placed onto the
wireline.

Another role of the 3518 EB is to provide Cablehead Voltage (CHV) and
Spontaneous Potential (SP).

Also, as an integrated part of its mechanical makeup, there resides a Gamma
Ray (GR) instrument within the 3518 EB housing --- electrically, it responds as
any other Focus instrument connected to the Instrument Bus, sharing only
common power supplies with the Telemetry circuits.

Although still in development, the Telemetry has hardware support for Hybrid and
Battery Mode.  In these modes, the Telemetry autonomously acquires data from
the tools and stores the data in memory.  The Telemetry has a 10 base-T
Ethernet interface to allow fast dumping of data from memory.


1 Early naming of this engineering project was “Matrix” and much of the terminology associated
with it still contains references to Matrix.  As the engineering project became a public service,
Marketing decided the name should be changed to “Focus.”  References in older support and
requirements documents were not changed to reflect this name change.  Throughout much of the
documentation, the terms “Focus” and “Matrix” are used interchangeably, i.e. - Matrix Instrument

Wireline Considerations:
In the Focus system, instruments can operate with 7-conductor wirelines, a
single conductor wireline, or without an electrical line.  When there is no electrical
wireline, the Focus string can operate with battery power.  A Focus Battery
Module is required.
If there is no electrical wireline, or if the bandwidth of the wireline is very limited,
the 3518 EB/FB can record data in local memory, instead of sending it to the
surface.  The downhole Telemetry can be sent tables containing the list of
instruments to be sampled at regular intervals.  This is the standard mode of
operation when using batteries.

Matrix Instrument Bus
The standard Focus field joint uses either a 27 or 18-pin connector.  The only
difference is the 9 outside ring of pins – they are reserved for connecting to the
wireline according to Table 1.  Any instrument intended to be placed above the
Telemetry must include these wireline pins.  This allows Telemetry access to the
wireline.

A mechanical side note to the connector – there is no
electrical connection to the center pin; it is a 10-32
threaded female pin which holds the connector
together.  A standard “T” handle (P/N F078902000) is
used to pull the connector from its position when
disassembling an instrument.  If a T-handle tool cannot
be located, a standard 10-32 screw of any length may
be substituted.

The power supply assembly of the 3518 FB is comprised of four circuit boards
and several chassis mounted components, as shown in the wiring diagram of
A3000072 WRD and Figure 2.  Figure 2 is a block diagram of the 3518 FB
Telemetry Power Section Instrument Assembly.  The four power supply boards
are:

Power Inhibit Controller (PIC) – A3000305000
The 3518 FB Telemetry Power Section converts the nominal 250 VDC Cablehead
voltage to the required +28 VDC (4 Amps max.) bus voltage.  The normal
operating range for Cablehead voltage is 150 – 320 VDC.  If the Cablehead
voltage is set outside this window, the power supply will shut down and can only
be restarted by lowering the surface supply to zero.  To insure the power supply
does not oscillate on power-up, the instrument requires a minimum of 225 VDC to
start.  The upper limit, lower limit and the starting point are all controlled by the
PIC board.

3518 EB TELEMETRY
As mentioned earlier, the 3518 EB Telemetry instrument plays an important role
in the communications link between surface and downhole equipment.  For
Hybrid or Battery operated modes, the role of the Telemetry changes somewhat.
Since each Focus downhole instrument has the ability to receive and interpret
surface commands, the Telemetry instrument need only regenerate these signals
from wireline signals.  The 3518 EB contains an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate
Array) chip that converts wireline AMI signals into standard Manchester (and vice
versa) and ensures received and transmitted words are viable before passing
them to the appropriate recipient, whether downhole instrument or surface panel.

Focus instruments respond in the same way as WTS instruments, in that they
communicate using Mode 2, Mode 5 or Mode 7.  For more details on WTS
communications, see WTS-Tool Interface Specifications 059448-000.
The 3518 EB Telemetry receives AMI surface commands and regenerates it into
Manchester format before passing it down to the tool string via the Matrix
Instrument Bus (MIB).  Conversely, it receives tool data and converts it bit for bit
into AMI format to place it back onto the wireline.  Modal transformers mounted
on the backbone of the Telemetry combine/split wireline signals and tool power.
Power is returned to the 3518 FB while data signals are routed to the Wireline
Interface Board.  The Wireline Interface Board’s function is to decode and route
signals between the CPU, wireline and MIB.
When the need arises for the Telemetry to respond to surface commands, the
FPGA routes signals accordingly in response to the CPU Board.
Another function of the Telemetry is to acquire data from CHV and SP (both
surface and armor) measurements.  Theses circuits can be found on the CPU
board."
3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Training Supplement - 2.3 GAMMA RAY,"GAMMA RAY
The Telemetry also contains an integrated Gamma Ray module.  It is designed
into the Telemetry to shorten the overall tool string length.  As a stand-alone tool,
another instrument like the Gamma Ray would add weight and length because of
the field joints and power supplies.  By combining this tool with the Telemetry, it
eliminates those extra pieces.
The Gamma Ray electronics is fashioned after many of its predecessors.  It
begins with detecting the pulses from the Photomultiplier Tube, sending them
through a discriminator circuit and then to a counter where they can be ultimately
sent to the surface.
The Gamma Ray module of this instrument is slightly more sophisticated.  It uses
a microprocessor to handle the counts, A/D conversion, high voltage gain control,
measuring elapsed time, measuring temperature and communicating with the
surface.

3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Training Supplement - 3.0 MECHANICAL OPERATION,"MECHANICAL OPERATION

The 3518 EB/FB Telemetry is designed to operate as a pair.  It can be
mechanically broken down into two parts.  The 45-pin electro/mechanical joint
between them is a non-rotating thread joint2 that can easily separate the two
pieces.
Thread protectors should be inserted at any exposed joint to avoid thread
damage.
The 3-1/8” steel housings protect sensitive electronics from high pressure
conditions found in the wellbore (max. 10,000 psi).  Once connected together,
the 3518 EB and FB top and bottom sub of the pair appear as 27-pin standard
Focus field joints.  This configuration allows any Focus instrument containing
feedthrough wires 1 – 9 to be operated above the Telemetry, since these pins
connect to wireline conductors.
A special feature of the 3518 FB is an integrated Ethernet port embedded into the
heat sink at the top sub.  Removing the cover with an Allen wrench reveals a 6-
pin pressure bulkhead that allows connection to a computer for downloading data
stored in memory after running either in Hybrid or Memory Mode.  Connection to
this port requires a special cable and interface box.

2 Considered as a “lab joint” that should remain connected except for preventive maintenance,
this joint is made from Titanium.  The spin collar contains smaller wrench holes which alerts field
personnel that it is not a field joint where the tool string is broken apart."

2.0 CONTROLLER BOARD
Refer to drawing 197392-000 and schematic 197392-100 for component locations
for the following descriptions. 

CPU AND MEMORY

The circuitry of the CPU board centers around U2, a Motorola MCF5407 (Coldfire)
microprocessor.  The Coldfire is a 32-bit embedded microprocessor.  U1 controls
the power up reset for the CPU.

U3 is a tri-state buffer used to drive the Coldfire’s configuration pins during reset.
The lower byte of the Coldfire’s data bus, D7 through D0, serves as configuration
pins during reset.  The Coldfire latches the configuration setting, driven by U3, on
the rising edge of the reset signal (RESET–).  When the reset signal is high, U3 is
tri-stated.  Among other things, the configuration pins are used to set the Coldfire’s
internal clock frequency and port size of chip-select 0.

See sheet 4 of the schematic for memory circuits.  U16 provides 2 Mbytes of Flash
Memory.  The Flash Memory interface is 8 bits wide.  U17 provides 2 Mbytes of
synchronous static RAM.  The Coldfire has a fast 32-bit wide interface to RAM.
After reset, the CPU copies its code from Flash Memory into RAM and begins
executing from RAM."
3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.2 BOARD RESET..............................................................................................3,"BOARD RESET

The board’s reset signal is generated by U1.  The reset threshold is 2.93 V.  Two
reset signals are generated by U1, RESET– and RESETA–.  RESETA– provides a
glitch-free reset signal valid down to 0 volts.  RESET– provides the reset signal for
the Coldfire and Actel FPGA.  The RESET– signal is subject to glitches as the
3.3 V ramps up because the Coldfire and FPGA will momentarily drive this signal
while the supply voltage ramps up.

The CPU can initiate a board-level reset by writing to a control register in the
FPGA.  This write function will cause the FPGA to turn ON transistor Q1, causing
U1 to reset the microprocessor (U2) and the rest of the board.

Finally, a reset switch, SW1, is located near U2 and can be pressed to reset the

the buffer are fed to the Coldfire (U2), RAM (U17), Actel FPGA (U6), and
CoolRunner II CPLD (U8)."
3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.4 RELAY CONTROL .........................................................................................4,"RELAY CONTROL

A non-latching relay is located on the terminal board (197673-000).  The function
of this relay is to switch pin 7 of the top 45-pin connector (P1) for use as conductor
7 in multi-conductor mode or as data signal in single-conductor mode.  Since the
normal resting state of the relay is the single-conductor mode, the coil must be
energized when the tool is operating in the multi-conductor mode.

Refer to the upper left corner of sheet 4 for this circuit.  The Coldfire provides two
relay control signals, RLYSW and RLYHOLD.  RLYSW and RLYHOLD control
transistors Q7 and Q8, respectively.  When the Coldfire first switches the relay into
multi-conductor mode, it turns ON both transistors.  After holding both transistors
ON for at least 1msec and allowing the armature to switch over, it turns transistor
Q7 OFF to conserve power by reducing the relay’s coil current by half.  Transistor
Q9 acts as a gate for transistors Q7 and Q8.  When Q9 is OFF, the relay is
prevented from turning ON regardless of the state of Q7 and Q8.  Q9 is controlled
by RESETA– so that it will be in the OFF condition while the board is in reset.  The
gating mechanism was put in place because the Coldfire will momentarily assert
RLYSW and RLYHOLD while it is powering up."

Subset 2.  The serial port interface (sheet 4) operates at a baud rate of 57600, with
a format of 8 data bits, even parity, and one stop bit.  Optocoupler U15 isolates the

Refer to the lower part of sheet 4.  Two low-dropout (LDO) regulators provide the
core voltages needed for the Coldfire and the Actel FPGA.  The Coldfire requires a
1.8 V core voltage and a 3.3 V IO voltage.  The FPGA requires a 2.5 V core voltage
and a 3.3 V IO voltage.  U4 provides a 1.8 V reference for both regulators.  A 1.8 V
regulator is formed by U18 and Q5.  Q5 increases the current output capability of
op amp U18.  A PNP pass transistor arrangement is used to achieve a low-dropout
voltage.  A 2.5 V regulator is formed by U19 and Q6.  Resistor values R34 and R50
are chosen to generate a 2.5 V output from the 1.8 V reference.  Diodes D7, D8,
and D9 are in place to make sure the 1.8 V does not trail too far below the 3.3 V
when the supply voltage ramps up.  Diode D10 ensures that the 3.3 V supply does
not drop too far below the 1.8 V supply when the board is powered down."

U12 on sheet 3 is a 10 base-T Ethernet controller.  Transformers T1 and T2 isolate
the TX and RX lines.  The Actel FPGA generates the proper timing of the IOR–

FPGA maps the Ethernet Controller to chip-select CS3.  The Ethernet Controller
provides an active-high interrupt signal.  This signal, ETH_IRQ, is fed into the
FPGA where it is inverted and routed to the Coldfire’s IRQ1 interrupt.  The data
lines to the Ethernet Controller are byte swapped to accommodate the Ethernet
Controller’s ISA based interface.
The 20 MHz clock required by U12 is generated by the FPGA.  The FPGA simply
divides the 40 MHz system clock by 2 to generate the clock (ETH_CLK) for the
Ethernet controller."
3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.8 SP MEASUREMENT......................................................................................5,"SP MEASUREMENT

The CPU Board measures Spontaneous Potential (SP) with respect to both the
surface-electrode and to armor.  The measurements are performed simultaneously
and independent of each other.  These measurements are reported in Subset 2.
SP is sampled at a rate of 5 K samples per second.  When Subset 2 is requested
from the Telemetry, the CPU will report the average of the last 128 samples
measured.

U22 (sheet 5) is an instrumentation amplifier that measures the SP voltage with
respect to the surface-electrode.  The SP inputs are protected with back-to-back
diodes, D1 & D2, which clamp the voltage to 8.5 V.  This SP signal is first filtered
by R23, C114, and R24.  The differential voltage is converted to a single-ended

70 Hz low-pass Butterworth filter.

U13 generates a 2.5 V reference for the analog-to-digital converter, U29.  The ADC
is a 16-bit SAR.  It is configured for a measurement range of -2.5 V to +2.5 V.  U21
buffers the 2.5 V reference and feeds it into the resistor scaling network in the
ADC’s front end.

The circuit for measuring SP with respect to armor is similar to that described
above.

The ADC’s are read serially by the Actel FPGA (U6 on sheet 2).  Every 200µs, the
FPGA will initiate a conversion by strobing CNVST/ low.  After sensing both ADC’s
busy signals (BUSY_SUR and BUSY_DWN) go inactive, the FPGA will clock out
32 data bits from the ADC’s.  The first 16 clocks shift the surface SP and the
second 16 clocks shift the armor SP.  Serial data for both ADC’s is shifted over the
same SD line since they are daisy-chained together.  The serial clock line (SCLK)
is discontinuous, and will remain inactive when the FPGA is not reading data from
the ADC’s.  The FPGA contains two 128 word FIFOs to store the last 128 samples
from each ADC.  The CPU reads the FIFOs and reports the average when Subset
2 is requested by the surface system."

Because it is still under development, many of the components of this circuit are
not installed.  Later, in cases where these components will be required, they can
be easily installed.
The Timer circuit (left side of sheet 3) is needed only for the Hybrid and Battery
modes.  In the Battery mode, the Timer allows the tool string to be powered down
with just the Timer Circuit powered, and automatically power up again after a
programmed time has been reached.  This feature allows a battery-powered tool
string to remain OFF while being lowered into the borehole, and then automatically
turn ON to log the well.  While the tool string is OFF, only the Timer Circuit on the
CPU board remains powered ON.  The Timer Circuit’s power is provided by a
small auxiliary power supply located in the 4444 XA Battery Module.  In both the
Hybrid and Battery modes, the CPU depends on the Timer to provide a periodic
interrupt that the CPU uses to acquire data from the tools on a time-driven basis.

The Timer is implemented in a Xilinx CoolRunner II CPLD (U8).  The Timer’s
responsibility is to maintain time and provide a periodic interrupt at a
programmable rate to the CPU.  The Timer Circuit has a separate power input (pin
16 of connector P1) to supply power to it while the rest of the board is powered
down.  Diodes D4 and D5 form an OR circuit and are power diodes that allow the
Timer to obtain power from the 12 V supply when it’s available.  The Timer
produces a power enable signal that feeds to transistor Q3.  The power enable

Oscillator Y2 provides a 10 kHz clock for the CPLD.  U9 resets the CPLD when the
Timer’s 3.3 V supply drops below 2.93 V.  The CPU has access to the Timer
registers through an 8-bit wide data bus.  The CPU uses chip-select CS4 to select
the Timer.  The Timer monitors the RESETA– signal and will lock out its interface
to the CPU when the RESETA– signal is asserted LOW.  This feature is necessary
to prevent unintentional writes to the Timer’s internal register when the CPU is
powering up or powering down.  The Timer also goes into a tri-state mode for all of
its outputs when RESETA– is asserted.

Transistor Q2 and resistors R36 and R37 are used to generate a signal
(BATT_FLG) that the CPU reads to determine when it’s in the battery mode.
BATT_FLG is asserted low when timer power is present on pin 16 of connector

2.10 SYNCHRONOUS SERIAL PORT

The CPU Board is linked to the Memory Board (197390-000) through a 10 Mbit/sec
synchronous serial port.  The CPU and Memory Board each control a frame sync
and data line.  They share a common clock.  The Serial Port logic is implemented
in the Actel FPGA.  The CPU can poll on ready flags or configure the FPGA to
generate an interrupt when the receiver contains new data or when the transmitter
has finished transmitting a word.  The CPU can also transfer data to or from the
serial port interface via DMA.  The FPGA uses DREQ0 and DREQ1 to pace the
flow of data for DMA operations.

U20 buffers the clock (SPI_CLK), frame sync (TFS), and data (DT) signals that are
driven by the CPU Board.  U14 is a Schmitt trigger inverter that buffers the
incoming frame sync (RFS) and data signal (DR) driven by the Memory Board."

2.11 MANCHESTER ENCODERS/DECODERS

In addition to the functionality already discussed, the Actel FPGA (U6) also
contains the Manchester encoders, decoders, and regenerator logic.

In the legacy (WTS/Focus) mode of operation, the FPGA autonomously decodes
Mode 2 commands on the wireline and regenerates it on the CMD channel of the
Instrument Bus.  The FPGA fully decodes the command and then writes it into an
encoder to pass it onto the Instrument Bus.  The FPGA will only regenerate the
command if it has detected no NVM or parity errors.  Since the FPGA decodes the
command and then encodes it, there is a one word delay from the time the
command appears on the wireline, to the time it appears on the instrument bus.

The FPGA passes data from the instrument bus to the wireline in a different
manner.  Instead of decoding a word and re-encoding it, the FPGA repeats the

data from the instrument bus to the wireline on an edge-for-edge basis.  When the
FPGA detects that the signal level on a particular channel changes state, the
FPGA generates a positive or negative AMI pulse on the wireline for that channel’s
corresponding mode.  The AMI pulse is one-fourth of a bit period.  For Mode 2, the
pulse is 12µs wide.  For Modes 5 and 7, the pulse is 2.67µs wide.

The FPGA contains decode logic that will generate an interrupt to the CPU when a
command is received that is addressed to the telemetry.  When an error-free
command is received that is addressed to the telemetry, the FPGA will enable the
decoder interrupt to notify the CPU that a command for it has been received.  The
FPGA will leave the interrupt enabled to allow the CPU to receive any parameters
that may follow.  The FPGA will not disable the interrupt until it detects an error-
free command addressed to another tool.  In this manner, the CPU is not bothered
by traffic directed to other tools.

In Hybrid or Battery mode, the CPU needs direct control of the instrument bus to
send commands and receive data from other tools.  In these modes, the CPU
configures the FPGA to disable the regenerator and repeaters, and enable the
encoder and decoders for the instrument bus.  In this configuration, the CPU can
transmit commands and receive data from the instrument bus.

U7 is a Schmitt trigger inverter used to perform 5 V to 3.3 V level conversion of the
Manchester signals received from the Wireline Interface Board (F197394000).

The FPGA contains an internal Phase Lock Loop (PLL), which is used to generate
a 12 MHz clock for the encoder and decoder logic.  This clock output can be
monitored on TP19."

WIRELINE MODE 2 RECEIVER

The top half of Sheet 1 contains the Mode 2 receiver circuit.  Mode 2 signals enter

suppress any high-frequency noise.
The amplified and filtered signal then feeds into two comparators (U1 and U5) that
create two digital signals, WM2 R_HI and WM2 R_LO.  WM2 R_HI is high whenever
the amplified receive signal is greater than 200mV.  WM2 R_LO is high whenever

The two digital signals, WM2 R_HI and WM2 R_LO, feed into the Actel FPGA on

WIRELINE TRANSMITTERS – MODE 2, 5, 7

The bottom half of Sheet 1 contains the Mode 2 transmitter circuit.  The Mode 2
transmitter consists of two identical driver circuits, each driving one end of a
winding of chassis-mounted modal transformer T2.  The two driver circuits are
used in a complimentary fashion to double the voltage applied to the modal
transformer.  With each driver capable of delivering ±9 V, the transmitter can
provide up to ±18 V (depending on the load) to drive the modal transformer.

U6 and U10 [U11 and U15]2 are Schmitt trigger inverters used to buffer the control
signals from the FPGA on the CPU board (197392-000).  U9 [U14] and its
associated resistors form a difference amplifier that is used to convert the two 3.3 V
unipolar input signals into a single bipolar ±9 V signal at TP7 [TP9].  A two pole
low-pass filter, formed by U8 [U13], filters the signal to reduce cross-talk.  A high-
current output buffer, U7 [U12], is used to drive the modal transformer.  The output
buffer is enclosed within the feedback loop of U8 [U13] to remove any offset that
may be introduced by the buffer.

Sheet 4 contains the single-conductor transmitter and receiver.  The single-
conductor receiver is located in the top half of the sheet.  This circuit is very similar
to that found in the 8248 EA Telemetry Tool.  The receiver contains three op amp
stages with a T-network feedback to correct for the frequency dependent
attenuation and phase-shift that signals suffer as they travel through the wireline.
The receiver is tuned to a particular wireline by selecting the appropriate jumpers
and potentiometer settings.  After equalization, the signal is fed into a comparator
formed by op amp U47.  U47 forms an inverting comparator with a threshold level
of approximately ±2 V.  U44 is used to convert the bipolar output of U47, into a TTL

the instrument bus through transformer T1.  U37, U38, and U39 are differential
receivers for channels 1, 2, and 3 on the instrument bus."

Sheet 5 contains both a P-channel and an N-channel MOSFET, U45.  The
MOSFETs switch power to the multi-conductor transmitters.  When the CPU is
operating in a mode that does not require the multi-conductor transmitters, i.e.
single-conductor or Battery mode, the CPU will turn off the transmitters to
conserve power.  U46 is a dual SPDT switch used to control the gate voltage of
the MOSFETs.  To turn ON the MOSFETs, the switch connects the gates to
ground.  To turn OFF the P-channel MOSFET, the switch connects the gate to
+12 V.  The switch connects the gate to -12 V to turn OFF the N-channel MOSFET.
TXPOWEN is a signal driven by the CPU Board to control the state of the
transmitter power.

LED’S

Five LED’s are provided on the Wireline Interface Board.  They are controlled by
the CPU board, but they are placed on the Wireline Interface Board so that they
may be visible when the two boards are installed on the chassis.  D10, D11, and
D12 are controlled by the microprocessor.  D8 and D9 are controlled by the
Ethernet Controller.  D8 is the activity LED, which blinks when the Ethernet
controller is sending or receiving packets.  D9 is the LINK LED, which turns ON
whenever a host is connected to the Ethernet port, or when the Ethernet controller
is placed in the loopback mode during testing.  Jumper JP7 is used to disable all of
the LED’s by disconnecting them from 3.3 V.

Testpoint TP34 is not really a testpoint, but an input used to place the CPU board
in the Flash Loader mode to program new firmware.  TP34 connects to a line
which has a pull-up resistor on the CPU board.  The CPU will enter Flash Loader

4.0 GAMMA RAY CIRCUITRY
The Matrix Telemetry has an integrated Gamma Ray module.  It is designed into
the Telemetry to shorten the overall tool string length.  As a stand-alone tool,
another instrument like the Gamma Ray would add weight and length because of
the field joints and power supplies.  By combining this tool with the Telemetry, it
eliminates those extra pieces.
The electronics is fashioned after many of its G/R predecessors.  It begins with
detecting the pulses from the Photomultiplier Tube, sending them through a
discriminator circuit and then to a counter where data can be ultimately sent to the
surface.
The Gamma Ray module of this instrument is slightly more sophisticated.  It uses
a microprocessor to handle the counts, A/D conversion, high voltage gain control,
measuring elapsed time, measuring temperature and communicating with the
surface.
The following graphics illustrate the interconnecting wiring associated with the
Gamma Ray module.  Some early-built Telemetries contain the board 198877-000;
it appears in the first graphic (Figure 3).  Later models of the Telemetry contain the
board A3000493000; its hookup is seen in the second graphic (Figure 4).  All

MICROPROCESSOR
The heart of the Gamma Ray PC board is the microprocessor, U3, which controls
all of the action of the circuit.  This unique chip contains several counters, an A/D
converter and inputs/outputs necessary to handle communications.  It also has
internal ROM that contains processing firmware and internal RAM for holding data.
Support devices of the microprocessor are:
•
U7 – a 16 MHz oscillator,
•
U9 – flash memory for holding tool parameters,
•
U4 – a precision voltage reference for the A/D converter,
•
U12 – a frequency divider chip for deriving communication frequencies."

COMMUNICATIONS
Communications with surface equipment, like other tools in the Matrix tool string, is
accomplished using Manchester words.
The Matrix Instrument Bus (MIB) carries commands for all tools of the tool string.
Only when a command contains the correct address for a given tool does it
respond.  Commands enter the Gamma Ray PC board via pins 8 and 9 of
connector J1.  Commands are transformer-coupled (T2) to one of the differential
amplifiers of U8.  The output of U8 connects to the UDI pin of the Manchester
Encoder/Decoder chip, U6.  Decoding commands, the Manchester chip
determines whether the word is valid, and if so, passes the 16-bit word to the
microprocessor via the SDO pin.  Firmware determines which command has been

3518 EB Telemetry – Circuit Description
130960-945 / 3518 EB
JULY 2004

If answering that command requires sending data back to the surface, the
microprocessor passes serial data to the Manchester chip for encoding on the SDI
pin.  As the data word is encoded into Manchester format, it is clocked out the
BZO\ and BOO\ outputs to driver chip U5.  This chip drives transformer T1 which
couples the data to the MIB.  The instrument bus data lines tie to connector J1,
pins 3 and 4.  Modal transformers within the Telemetry drive the wireline with
signal levels necessary to reach the surface."
3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.3 DETECTING PULSES .................................................................................15,"DETECTING PULSES
As with other G/R detectors, hardware consists of a detecting crystal, coupled to a
photomultiplier (PM) tube.  Gamma rays from the formation enter the crystal where
they ionize and give off energy.  This ionization energy is converted into tiny
flashes of light (photons).  In the PM tube, these photons are changed into
electrical pulses that are amplified through a series of ten dynodes.
Voltage variations from the tube are proportional to the energy of the incident
gamma rays.  Since different levels of gamma radiation (i.e., count rates) are
associated with different types of rock, the information from the detector can be
used to indicate formation lithology.  Higher gamma ray count rates are commonly
associated with the presence of shale.
Pulses from the PM tube enter the G/R circuit at terminal J4 and are capacitor-
coupled from its high voltage source to the input of amplifier U10.  A calibrating pot
(R25) adjusts the signal strength to give a 2 V peak at TP1 when a Cesium 137
source is brought near to the detector working with the nominal high voltage
applied.
The pulses are then sent to a discriminator, U11, to eliminate base-noise and
shape the valid pulses into a square-wave signal.  It is the output of U11 that is
coupled to an internal counter of the microprocessor, U3.  Here the pulse count
accumulates until the acquisition cycle stops the counting."
3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.4 GAIN STABILIZATION .................................................................................15,"GAIN STABILIZATION
During actual operation, increased downhole temperatures cause the gain of the
photomultiplier tube to decrease.  To keep the sensitivity of the detector to gamma
rays constant, this drop in gain must be corrected.  This correction is accomplished
by increasing the high voltage applied to the PM Tube in a quantity that is
proportional to the temperature change.  Two relationships – gain vs. temperature
and gain vs. high-voltage – are characteristic of a particular tube type and are
used to stabilize the gain by means of a control loop.  Below is a discussion of the
various parts of this loop.
4.4.1 TEMPERATURE SENSING

A special combination chip, U4, contains a high precision voltage reference
circuit, which is its primary function.  However, it also contains a circuit that
16

3518 EB Telemetry – Circuit Description

compensates the voltage output with variations in temperature.  The output
of this circuit is available as a voltage that is proportional to the absolute
temperature (°K) that it senses.  It is this temperature sensitive circuit’s
output that is amplified at U2 A.  The output of U2 A becomes a signal that is
measured by another input of the microprocessor’s internal A/D converter.
Firmware within the microprocessor handles the processing of the data.
Eventually this data is sent to the surface as part of Subset 0.
4.4.2 HIGH VOLTAGE MONITOR

The next stage of the control loop monitors the high voltage.  This stage
consists of amplifier U2 B and associated components.  The amplifier ties to
the lower end of the resistive voltage divider network that biases the
dynodes (also the PM tube cathode connection) and has a gain of 10.  The
output of this amplifier is fed into one of the inputs of the A/D converter
internal to the microprocessor.  Capacitor C28 is used to provide low
impedance to the A/D converter input.
4.4.3 HIGH VOLTAGE CONTROL
The High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS) is a commercial item that is housed
in modular fashion.  It has an input pin that allows circuitry to control the
output voltage level.  The HV output is inversely proportional to the voltage
applied to this control input.
The microprocessor uses the measured temperature to determine the proper
value of the high voltage for those conditions.  This nominal value is
compared to the measured HV value and a correction is applied if needed.
The compensation is gradual.  This gradual change keeps the process from
over-compensating and putting the loop into a constant up-and-down
pattern.
The HVPS control is derived from a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) output of
the microprocessor.  The average value of the pulse train is amplified by U1,
configured as a voltage follower, which has its positive input connected to a
potentiometer.   The network of R1, R2 and R6 establishes a limited
adjustment range for the amplifier.  The amplifier output connects through
resistor R3, to pin 11 of the connector J1, which ties to the control pin of the
HVPS.  Note: At room temperature, pot R2 is adjusted until the output of the
HVPS is 1300 volts.
4.4.4 START-UP
When the tool is powered up at high temperatures (i.e. downhole) the
initialization portion of the downhole software measures the tool temperature
and applies an approximate initial value to the PWM circuitry to provide for a
fast turn-on.  The control loop just described takes over from this point to

The 3518 EB has three power supplies mounted on the electronics backbone.
Along with one of the supplies is an EMI filter module to drastically reduce
interference and interaction between supplies of other Matrix instruments.  These
self-contained, modular supplies mount on a heat-sinking channel and have
additional circuitry mounted on a PC board that is soldered directly to the pins of
the supply.  It is this additional circuitry that will be the topic of discussion for this
section.
Because the power supplies are modular, there is no repair of the unit.  It either
works or it doesn’t.  The only circuitry external to the module (U1) is some
inhibiting control and some additional output filtering.

POWER CONTROL CIRCUIT
Associated with at least one of the DC to DC power supply modules is an EMI filter
module.  In the Telemetry, it is the dual 12 V supply.  The PC board attached to this
module performs several control functions.  These control functions are described
below.
A +5 volt supply is generated for other chips on the PC board.  The supply
consists of a single dropping resistor (R3) and reference Zener diode (D1) to
establish the voltage.  This supply is connected to the output of the EMI filter
module (U1).  It is this +28 V EMI filter output that connects to the input of other DC
to DC converter modules within the instrument.  See the schematic below.


heart of the power control circuitry is a programmable microcontroller (U3).  Values
for resistor R7 and capacitor C3 have been selected to give an operating
frequency of approximately 1 MHz.  Supplied with +5 volts from the supply of
(1) A threshold voltage is established using chip U4.  The voltage divider
consisting of R6 and R8 are chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for
instrument power) is present on R6, the reset chip removes the LOW on pin 7
which in turn removes the reset from the microcontroller, U3, allowing it to do
its job.
(2) Jumper inputs to the microcontroller chip, U3, set different length delay
times.  Delay times are established for different tools to limit the current
demand when the Focus tool sting is first powered up.  Delay times, in
milliseconds, and their jumpers are shown in the table below.

(3) When power is first applied to the microcontroller, output RA1 of U3 pin 18
is floating (open collector circuit).  Resistor R4 pulls the base of Q1 HIGH
turning it ON.  This state applies a ground potential to all power supplies tied to
the Q1 collector.  Diodes (D2 – D4) form an OR function in the collector circuit,
allowing control over different power supplies.  By tying the INHIBIT pin (active
low) of each DC-to-DC converter module within an instrument to one of these
control terminals (E5, E6 or E7), you can independently control its ON/OFF
function.  With Q1 initially turned ON, no power supply module can turn ON.  It
is not until the time-out function is completed by U3 that output RA1 can
transition LOW, turning OFF Q1.  With Q1 turned OFF, power supplies are
allowed to turn ON because their INHIBIT is removed.  As the power supplies
turn ON, their current demand is confined to that particular instrument.  Again,

Refer to drawing 198384-100 for the complete schematic of the Power
Controller board.  As an added feature of this circuit, Power Supply #2 or
Power Supply #3 can be turned OFF by an external source via opto-isolator
U2.  Terminal E8 is tied to a positive voltage.  Taking control terminal E9 or
E10 LOW causes its respective switch to close.  This applies a ground potential
to the INHIBIT input of the supply that is tied to its control terminal, E6 or E7.
This LOW turns OFF the respective power supply.  Terminal E9 controls a
power supply (P.S.2) connected to terminal E6, while E10 controls a supply
(P.S.3) connected to terminal E7.  Thus, independent control is available if
needed.  Power supplies connected to E5 are solely controlled by the timing
function associated with the operation of transistor Q1.  See the schematic
below."
3518EB-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"The 3518 Focus Telemetry is a communications device for the Focus downhole
system.  This is a combination instrument comprised of the 3518 FB, the power
module, the 3518 EB, the communications module and the 3518 EG, the Gamma
Ray module.


The 3518 FB, the power module, converts a nominal wireline 250 VDC voltage to
+28 VDC as part of the Matrix1 Instrument Bus (MIB).  +28 VDC is generated to
provide power for instrument electronics and motors.  For more details, see
manual 130961-915.

The primary role of the 3518 EB module is to serve as a communications bridge
between the wireline and the MIB.  To do this, the Focus Telemetry accepts
surface commands in the AMI format.  The Telemetry determines if the received
word is valid, and if so, the entire word is regenerated in Manchester UDI format
and sent out on the MIB.  Focus instruments connected to the MIB are responsible
for their own interpretation and response to the Manchester signal.  Conversely,
instrument data sent back to the surface is received by the Telemetry and
converted to AMI pulse format before being placed onto the wireline.

Another role of the 3518 EB is to provide Cablehead Voltage (CHV) and
Spontaneous Potential (SP).

Also, as an integrated part of its mechanical makeup, there resides a Gamma Ray
(GR) instrument within the 3518 EB housing --- electrically, it responds as any
other Focus instrument connected to the Instrument Bus, sharing only common
power supplies with the Telemetry circuits.

Although still in development, the Telemetry has hardware support for Hybrid and
Battery Mode.  In these modes, the Telemetry autonomously acquires data from
the tools and stores the data in memory.  The Telemetry has a 10 base-T Ethernet
interface to allow fast dumping of data from memory.

No pun intended, the focus of this document is to present the details of 3518 EB
communications module.


1 Early naming of this engineering project was “Matrix” and much of the terminology associated with it
still contains references to Matrix.  As the engineering project became a public service, Marketing decided
the name should be changed to “Focus.”  References in older support and requirements documents were not
changed to reflect this name change.  Throughout much of the documentation, the terms “Focus” and
“Matrix” are used interchangeably, i.e. - Matrix Instrument Bus was not renamed Focus Instrument Bus.

COMMUNICATIONS CONTROL

The 3518 XA Matrix Telemetry instrument plays an important role in the communications link
between surface and downhole equipment.  It is especially critical in Hybrid1 or Battery2
operated modes.  Since each Matrix downhole instrument has the ability to receive and
interpret surface commands, the burden for doing this is no longer solely the function of the
telemetry instrument.  However, the 3518 XA contains an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate
Array) chip that ensures received and transmitted Manchester words are viable before
passing them to the appropriate recipient, whether downhole instrument or surface panel.
Matrix instruments respond very much like WTS instruments, in that they communicate
using Mode 2, Mode 5 or Mode 7.  For more details on WTS communications, see WTS-
Tool Interface Specifications 059448-000.
The Matrix Telemetry passes the surface commands down to the tool string via the Matrix
Instrument Bus (MIB) and passes the tool data to the surface without acting as anything
more than a conduit.  Modal transformers mounted on the backbone of the Telemetry couple
wireline signals to the Transceiver Board and on this board is an FPGA (Field
Programmable Gate Array) chip that routes these signals to the tools.
When the need arises for the Telemetry circuits to respond to surface commands, the FPGA
routes signals according to the response of the CPU Board.
A secondary function of the Matrix Telemetry is to acquire data from several sensors located
in different places and send their measurements to the surface via the CPU Board.  The
Sensor Board carries out this function."
3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.0 GAMMA RAY SECTION............................................................................................25,"GAMMA RAY SECTION

The third part of the Matrix Telemetry is an integrated Gamma Ray section.  It is designed
into the Telemetry to shorten the overall tool string length.  As a stand-along tool, it would
add weight and length because of the extra field joints and power supplies.  By combining
this function with the Telemetry, it rids the tool string of this unnecessary burden.
The electronics is fashioned after many of its predecessors.  It begins with detecting the
pulses from the Photomultiplier Tube, sending them through a discriminator circuit and then
to a counter where they can be ultimately sent to the surface.
The Gamma Ray section of this instrument is slightly more sophisticated.  It uses a
microprocessor to handle the counts, A/D conversion, high voltage gain control, measuring
elapsed time, measuring temperature and communicating with the surface.
The following graphic illustrates the interconnecting wiring associated with the Gamma Ray
section.  All Telemetry wiring connects to the Gamma Ray PC board, 198877-000, via a
single connector.  From there, voltage is provided to the High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS)
and pulses return to be processed.  For ease of assembly, wiring to the connector comes
from the Gamma Ray Terminal board, 198879-000.

HIGH VOLTAGE STARTUP PROTECTION PCB
Refer to schematic drawing 199678-100 during this discussion.  This PCB controls
activation of the gated current regulator U2, as discussed in Section  2.2.8.  The
Protection PCB enables U2 for 30 seconds only during power-up.  The Protection
PCB activates and starts its internal timeout function once Vin crosses 50 volt.
During this timeout interval, TP is pulled “high”, which allows U2 to operate.  At the
end of the 30-second timeout period, TP is pulled “low”, deactivating U2.  TP remains
“low “until the Protection PCB circuitry is reset, which happens when Vin drops below

APPENDIX A: DC POWER SUPPLY MODULES

The Matrix tool string has two basic types of power supplies mounted on the individual
instrument’s backbone.  Along with one of the supplies is an EMI filter module to
drastically reduce interference and interaction between supplies of other Matrix
instruments.  These self-contained, modular supplies mount on a heat-sinking channel
and have additional circuitry mounted on a PC board that is soldered directly to the
pins of the supply.  It is this additional circuitry that will be the topic of discussion for
this section.
Because the power supplies are modular, there is no repair of the unit.  It either works
or it doesn’t.  The only circuitry external to the module (U1) is some inhibiting control
and some additional output filtering.

TYPE 1: Single Power Supply
See the schematic below for a typical configuration of the external components for a
single output power module.


Note: An unlabeled circle representing a terminal is shown on the INHIBIT pin of U1.  In reality,
it is not there; this is just an indicator that a wire is connected is to this point.  Design changes
have removed capacitor C2 and a wire is soldered to the pad that connects to pin 2 of the
module.  The other end of this wire connects to the control circuit found on the PC board
associated with the EMI filter.
Instrument power is defined as +28 volts for the Matrix tool string and originates from
other circuitry found in the Telemetry/GR instrument.  This voltage first is routed to an
EMI filter module before being applied to a DC to DC converter module; thus, the
voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered +28 V.  Terminal E2 is tied to the return line of the
EMI filter output.  Pins 6, 7 and 8 of U1 are tied to chassis ground which, in turn, is tied
to cable armor.  Two independent windings of a choke, L1, filter voltage spikes on the
output of the converter module.  Provision is made at J1 for trimming the output

voltage under expected loads.  In most cases, this provision is left unused.  Additional
output filtering is provided by capacitors C3, C4 and C5.

TYPE2: Dual Power Supply
In the case where a power supply module generates an output of dual polarity, the
associated circuitry is slightly modified from that of the single supply.  See the
Typical Dual Power Supply Filter Circuit

Note: An unlabeled circle representing a terminal is shown on the INHIBIT pin of U1.  In reality,
it is not there; this is just an indicator that a wire is connected is to this point.  Design changes
have removed capacitor C2 and a wire is soldered to the pad that connects to pin 2 of the
module.  The other end of this wire connects to the control circuit found on the PC board
associated with the EMI filter.

Again, instrument power first passes through an EMI filter module before being
applied to any DC to DC converter module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered
+28 V.  Terminal E2 is tied to the return line of the EMI filter output.  Pins 6, 7 and 8 of
U1 are tied to chassis ground, which is tied to cable armor.  Three independent
windings of a choke, L1, filter voltage spikes on the output of the module.  No
provision is made for trimming the output voltage.  Additional output filtering is
provided by capacitors C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7.

Power Control Circuit
Associated with at least one of the DC to DC power supply modules is an EMI filter
module.  The PC board attached to the EMI module performs several control
functions.  These control functions are described below.
A simple +5 volt supply is generated for other chips on the PC board.  This simple
supply is connected to the output of the EMI filter module (U1).  It is this +28 V EMI
filter output that also connects to the input of other DC to DC converter modules within
the instrument.  The supply consists of a single dropping resistor (R3) and reference
Zener diode (D1) to establish the voltage. See the schematic below.


Refer to schematic diagram of the Power Supply Control circuit on page 33.  The heart
of the power control circuitry is a programmable microcontroller (U3).  Values for
resistor R7 and capacitor C3 have been selected to give an operating frequency of
approximately 1 MHz.  Supplied with +5 volts from the supply of Figure 19, the
microcontroller acts as a timer to control the turn-on time of anything tied to its output.
There are basically three functions concerning this circuit - (1) a voltage threshold, (2)
a delay circuit and (3) a control/inhibit circuit.
(1) A threshold voltage is established using chip U4.  The voltage divider consisting
of R6 and R8 are chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for instrument power) is
present on R6, the reset chip removes the LOW on pin 7 which in turn removes the
reset from the microcontroller, U3, allowing it to operate.
(2) Jumper inputs to the microcontroller chip, U3, set different length delay times.
Delay times are established for different tools in an effort to limit the current
demand when the Matrix tool sting is first powered up.  Delay times, in
milliseconds, and their jumpers are shown in the table below.

(3) When power is first applied to the microcontroller, output RA1 of U3 pin 18 is
floating (open collector circuit).  Resistor R4 pulls the base of Q1 HIGH turning it
ON.  This state applies a ground potential to the INHIBIT pine of all power supplies
tied to the Q1 collector.  Diodes (D2 – D4) form an OR function in the collector
circuit, allowing control over different power supplies.  By tying the INHIBIT pin
(active low) of each DC-to-DC converter module within an instrument to one of
these control terminals (E5, E6 or E7), you can independently control its ON/OFF
function.  With Q1 initially turned ON, no power supply module can turn ON.  It is
not until the time-out function is completed by U3 that output RA1 can transition
LOW, turning OFF Q1.  With Q1 turned OFF, power supplies are allowed to turn
ON because their INHIBIT is removed.  As the power supplies turn ON, their
current demand is confined to the power supply modules of that particular
instrument.  Again, see the control circuit on page 33.

Refer to drawing 198384-100 for the complete schematic of the Power Controller
board.  As an added feature of this circuit, Power Supply #2 or Power Supply #3
can be turned OFF by an external source via opto-isolator U2.  Terminal E8 is tied
to a positive voltage.  Taking control terminal E9 or E10 LOW causes its respective
switch to close.  This switch closure applies a ground potential to the INHIBIT input
of the supply that is tied to its control terminal, E6 or E7.  This LOW turns OFF the
respective power supply.
Terminal E9 controls a power supply (P.S.2) connected to terminal E6, while E10
controls a supply (P.S.3) connected to terminal E7.  Thus, independent control is
available if needed.  Power supplies connected to E5 are solely controlled by the
timing function associated with the operation of transistor Q1, as discussed
previously.  See the schematic below."
3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION

The 3518 XA Matrix Telemetry contains circuitry that can be divided into three major
functions (1) power supply, (2) communications control and (3) an integrated Gamma Ray.
The power supply converts the incoming DC voltage into +28 Volts DC to power all Matrix
instruments of the tool string.  The major function of the Telemetry is, of course,
communications and this is controlled via a piggyback set of PC boards.  In an effort to
reduce overall tool string length and weight, a Gamma Ray instrument was designed into a
single package with the Telemetry."
3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.1 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION
The Power Supply Subassembly is comprised of four circuit boards and several chassis
mounted components, as shown on Telemetry Chassis Wiring Diagram – 198601-100.
The four power supply boards are:
•
Input Filter – 199001-000
•
Power Supply Controller – 199161-000
•
Output Filter – 198162-000
•
Auxiliary Power – 199000-000

The Telemetry Power Supply provides a regulated +28 Vdc at 4.0 amps maximum for the
MatriX tool string and Telemetry electronics from a cable head voltage (CHV) of 150 to
300 Vdc.  However, a CHV of 250 Vdc is required to start the power supply to ensure the
CHV does not drop below 150 Vdc, due to the voltage drop in the cable as the power
supply comes up.  The nominal operating voltage for the power supply is approximately
280 Vdc.  Should the applied voltage (CHV) exceed 320 Vdc, the power supply will
automatically shut down.
Note: This description does not take into account the chassis-mounted Power Supply
modules that provide power to the internal circuits of the Telemetry itself.  These supplies
are used throughout the tool string and information covering them can be found in
Appendix A and at the end of this document.
2.1.1 DC-DC CONVERTER OVERVIEW
The Telemetry Power Supply uses a half-bridge switching power topology which
consists of two alternately conducting MOSFETs (Q2, Q4), input filter energy storage
capacitors (C13-C20), switched mode power transformer T6, rectifier diodes (D1, D2),
switched mode choke (L1), and output filter capacitors (C1, C2, C5, C6).

Where:
Ein is the CHV, 150-300 Vdc
Ns/Np is the Power transformers, T6, turns ratio
1/T is the switching frequency, 120 kHz
ton is the MOSFET’s conduction time
Eo is the regulated 28 Vdc output

Regulation of the 28 Vdc output (Eo) is provided by alternately controlling the
conduction time (ton) of the Q2 and Q4 MOSFETs, which are switching at a frequency
of 120 kHz (1/T).  A closed loop feedback system compares Eo to a reference voltage
and adjusts the MOSFETs conduction time (ton) to maintain a constant output voltage
(Eo).  For example, as Ein increases, ton decreases proportionally to maintain a
constant Eo.

Tracing through one cycle of operation: Assume Q2 has been biased on, applying ½
Ein across the primary of T6 (Np).  The primary voltage pulse is inductively coupled to
the secondary winding (Ns) of T6.  The coupled secondary voltage forward biases
diode D1, permitting secondary current to flow through C1, C2, C5, C6, and returning
through L1 to the secondary center tap of T6.
When the conducting MOSFET (Q2) is turned off by U6, secondary current continues
to flow since the current through an inductor can not change instantaneously.  This is
referred to as the “freewheeling” period, which is the interval inductor L1 maintains the
load current until the opposite MOSFET begins conducting.  Current flows from L1,
through C1, C2, C5, C6, and returns through D1 and D2 during the “freewheeling”
period.
When the opposite MOSFET (Q4) is commanded on, the “freewheeling” period ends,
D2 is now forward biased, D1 is reverse biased, and current flows through C1, C2, C5,
and C6 again, returning through L1 to the secondary center tap of T6.  See Figure 3.
The cycle repeats with the next “freewheeling” period followed by Q2 being
commanded on.  U6 controls the MOSFET’s ton to maintain a constant 28-Vdc output
in spite of the varying load and Ein.

Refer to schematic drawing 199161-100 during the discussion of the Power Supply
Controller board.
2.2.1 VOLTAGE MODE PWM CONTROLLER
Voltage mode PWM (Pulse Width Modulator) Controller U6 provides the nucleus for
the converter control circuitry.  U6 provides the building blocks for the control circuitry
consisting of: error amplifiers, clock, PWM circuitry, and shutdown circuitry.  See
frequency and maximum duty cycle.  See Figure 4.

Control of the MOSFET conduction time is accomplished with PWM circuitry internal
to U6.  The PWM circuitry functions by comparing the error voltage at U6, pin 2 with
an internal ramp signal synchronized with the PWM’s clock to produce a duty cycle
modulated waveform, which is alternately directed to OUT A and OUT B.  See Figure

2.2.2 MOSFET DRIVERS
OUT A and OUT B of U6 are buffered by high-speed MOSFET drivers U3 and U11.
U3 and U11 provide the high current gate drive necessary to rapidly turn the
MOSFETs on and off.  Transformers T1 and T3 provide DC isolation between the
MOSFETs and analog ground.  Resistors R11 and R49 serve to control the MOSFETs
turn-on gate current and to dampen ringing at the gate.  Components R10, R50, D3,
and D9 provide an additional path for gate current, at turn-off, to ensure rapid turn-off
of Q2 and Q4.  See Figure 6.

2.2.3 CONTROL-LOOP CIRCUITRY
The control loop circuitry monitors Eo and controls ton to maintain a constant Eo as
changes occur at Ein and Io.
Sampled output voltage from the Output Filter Board is connected at Sense+ and
Sense- (P2-1, 6) and then to the first stage of differential amplifier U7, where the
sense voltage is attenuated (TP3).  The second stage of U7 produces the error
voltage (TP5) for U6 by integrating the difference of the sampled signal and reference
voltage derived from U8.  U8 provides a stable 5.0-Vdc reference.  R34 is a select
resistor used to adjust the 28-Vdc output. R34 is selected during test.  See Figure 7.
The error voltage (TP5) is applied through R19 to pin 2 (NI) of the PWM IC, U6.
Internal to U6, the error voltage is compared to the voltage ramp on U6 pins 6 and 7
(Figure 4, trace 2).  This comparison produces the ton pulse that is actually connected
to Out A or Out B of U6.  As previously discussed, a change in Eo is detected by the
control-loop circuitry and the circuit adjusts ton proportionately to Eo to correct.

2.2.4 OUTPUT OVER-CURRENT PROTECTION
Current transformer T2 samples T6’s primary current to provide over current
protection.  The primary current is used to detect output overload conditions since the
primary current is equal to the secondary current reflected by Np/Ns.  Resistors R29
and R35 function as turnover resistors, converting T1's secondary current to a voltage.
Components R40, R43, and C18 serve to divide and filter the signal prior to
application to U6, pin 9 [Ilim (TP6)].
The current signal at U6, pin 9 is compared to an internal reference voltage in U6 to
provide pulse-by-pulse current limiting or DC-DC converter shutdown.  If the voltage at
pin 9 of U1 exceeds 1.0 Vdc, MOSFET conduction is terminated, limiting the output
current.  The output current will continue to be limited until the overload condition is
removed.  Circuitry internal to U6 blanks any leading edge spikes present at pin 9 to
prevent false over-current limiting.  See Figure 8.

2.2.5 INPUT OVER-VOLTAGE, UNDER-VOLTAGE PROTECTION
Operation at excessively high or low CHV is inhibited to prevent possible damage to
the DC-DC converter.  Vin (P1-1) is divided by R1, R57, and R5 and applied to a dual
voltage comparator (U1).  The OV\ output inhibits DC-DC converter operation if Vin
exceeds 300 Vdc, while the UV\ output controls the input voltage operating range of
the DC-DC converter.  The UV\ signal prevents the DC-DC converter from turning on
until Vin is approximately 250 Vdc and will terminate operation if the Vin drops below
150 Vdc.
2.2.6 OUTPUT OVER VOLTAGE PROTECTION
Output over-voltage protection is also provided, should the DC-DC converter output
exceed 33 Vdc.  The over-voltage condition is detected by circuitry on the output filter
board.  Should an over-voltage condition occur, the signal OVS will go active.  Optical
coupler U4 serves to isolate the controller and output filter.  When the input of U4 goes
active, the coupler’s output, which is inverted by U5 and U12, pulls U9 pin 6 low.  This
sets the output of the RS latch (L28 VF\) and shuts down the DC-DC converter.  The
input power must be recycled to reset the latch.
L28 VF\, OV\, and UV\ are inputs to an Inverting NAND gate resulting in INHIBIT\ going
low if any one of the three abnormal operating conditions are detected.  INHIBIT\
controls U5 and Q1, which control the application of 15 Vdc operating power to U6.
INHIBIT\ is high and 15 Vdc operating power is provided to U6, permitting normal DC-
DC converter operation.
2.2.7 CONTROLLER OPERATING POWER
Operating power for the controller is provided by an external 15 Vdc from the Auxiliary
Power PCB.  The DC-DC converter is “said” to be self sustaining, i.e., it provides it
own 15 Vdc operating power, derived from an additional secondary on T6, once the
DC-DC converter is up and running.  However, a bootstrap circuit is required to initially
start the DC-DC converter (see next paragraph).  A linear regulator provides 5 Vdc
from the 15 Vdc to power the controllers digital components.  The 5 Vdc regulator is
composed of Q3, U13, U8, and associated passive components.

2.2.8 BOOTSTRAP CIRCUIT
Gated current regulator U2 and associated components form the bootstrap circuit.  At
start-up, U2 is initially biased on and supplies 30 mAdc to power the bootstrap circuit
components and charge the capacitor bank (C2-C5) on the Auxiliary Power PCB.
Zener D5 clamps the start-up voltage to 15 Vdc.  When Vin exceeds the power
supplies’ start threshold, the INHIBIT\ line is raised and Vccs ramps up.  When Vccs
exceeds 8.4 Vdc, the PWM IC starts pulsing the MOSFETs, via U3 and U11, resulting
in Vout (28 Vdc) starting to ramp up to its final value.  As Vout ramps up so does the
15 Vdc supplied by the auxiliary regulator.  Comparator U13 detects when Vcc
achieves its final value and pulls PSUP\ low.  U12 inverts PSUP\, which biases U10
on. With U10 on, U2’s gate-source junction is reverse biased and U2 is turned off.
The DC-DC converter is now self-sustaining, generating its own operating power via
the Auxiliary Power PCB.
Once the capacitor bank is charged and prior to Vccs exceeding 8.4 Vdc, U13 will
periodically turn off U2 to maintain Vcc at approximately 14 Vdc. See Figure 9. U2
remains on for 30 seconds after Vin crosses 50 Vdc. At the end of the 30-second
timeout period, U2’s gate-source junction is reverse biased by U10 and U2 is turned
off (refer to section  5.0 for additional information).

L1, C1, and C2 comprise a low-pass filter that averages the voltage pulses from the

low-pass filter stages comprised of L4 with C5 and C6; L5’s leakage inductance with C14,
C15; and C19 and L6’s leakage inductance with C20, C21 and C22.  Common mode

Note Figure 15; it shows the BOO waveforms of Mode 2 transmit signals (data) that
originate on the right side of sheet 1.

The top trace of this graphic is seen at resistor R27,
•
the second trace is observed at resistor R30,
•
third trace is a combined and amplified version of first two traces; (test point E7)
•
the bottom trace is the signal that drives the modal transformer (test point E6).
These BOO signals (top two traces) are output from the Manchester encoder circuitry
of the FPGA (U17).  Ultimately, both BZO and BOO signals are utilized and each one
used in a complementary fashion to provide up to a ±12 volt swing (depending on the
reflected load) to drive the modal transformer.
For the BOO signal, the gain stage of U10 amplifies the signal from a +5 volt level to a
±12 volt level.  The stages between test points E7 and E6 contain a 2-pole filter (U9)
and buffering (U8) to drive the modal transformer.  It is, ultimately, the detection of
these edges that are important in determining a proper Manchester signal.  Finally, the
output of buffers U8 and U11 apply a differential signal to drive the transformer.  This
bipolar output is found on connector P1 at pin 6.
In a similar manner, for the BZO signal, the gain stage of U13 amplifies the signal from
a +5 volt level to a ±12 volt level.  The stages between test points E9 and E8 contain a
2-pole filter (U12) and buffering (U11) to drive the modal transformer. Finally, the
output of buffers U11 and U8 apply a differential signal across the transformer.  This
bipolar output is found on connector P1 at pin 5.  BZO signals that drive the modal
transformer (bottom two traces) are opposite in polarity of those seen in Figure 15 to
give greater driving power for the Data signal.

At the bottom portion of sheet 1 is an identical circuit to the one just described.  It
handles the transmission of Mode 5 signals (data) instead of those of Mode 2.  The
differential outputs are found on connector P1 at pins 4 (+) and 3 (–).
The same circuit design is used for Mode 7 (sheet 3).  Output signals appear on
connector P1 at pins 2 (+) and 1 (–).
3.2.2 FPGA
The most notable feature of sheet 2 is the FPGA integrated circuit U17.  It is
surrounded by support components.  A 12 MHz oscillator chip, U2, drives internal
circuitry.  A 2.5 volt regulator, U31 and associated components, provides the needed
power for the FPGA.  LED’s D1 and D2 provide indications that the FPGA is working.
In the upper right corner of sheet 2 is a 6-wire serial port interface (SPI).  Chip U30 (A
& B) provides this bi-directional communication through pins of connector P2.  This
port is currently not used, but was designed into the instrument for future use.
Finally, the connections of J1 are signals that pass between the Transceiver Board
and the CPU Board.
3.2.3 MIB CIRCUITS
A dedicated transmitter circuit to the MatriX Instrument Bus (MIB) is found at the top of
the sheet 4.  The circuit provides encoded BZO and BOO signals to transformer T2
through driver chip U7.  These signals exit at connector P2 on pins 3 & 4.
Connected to P2 pins 1 & 2, a receiver circuit coupled to transformer T1 and amplifier
U29 provides a UDI signal to the FPGA for Mode 2.
Connected to P2 pins 5 & 6, a receiver circuit coupled to transformer T3 and amplifier

3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.3 SENSOR BOARD,"SENSOR BOARD
The purpose of the Telemetry Sensor board is to provide isolation and processing for the
Spontaneous Potential (SP) measurement and monitoring for several other items.  Power
supplied to this board comes from the two chassis mounted power modules, one being a
+5 Volt supply and the other a ±12 Volt supply.  The +5 Volt supply powers the digital
circuitry.  The ±12 Volt supply powers most analog circuits and is used to produce a ±5
Volt supply for any remaining analog circuitry.

Refer to the 4 sheets of schematic drawing 198875-100 and note that monitoring is
provided for the following conditions:
•
Internal temperature
•
+5 Volts (digital)
•
+12 Volts (analog)
•
-12 Volts (analog)
•
Cablehead voltage
•
+28 V Supply
•
Current draw for +28 V supply

In addition to monitoring these points, an RS232 interface is provided for serial
communication.
All of these functions are provided by the CPU (U10) located on the Sensor board and its
data is passed over, via the serial port, to the Telemetry’s main controller on the CPU
board 198870-000 to be transmitted to the surface.
To begin the discussion of the Sensor board, let’s start with the CPU and its support
circuitry.
3.3.1 CPU CIRCUITRY
Analog Devices is the manufacturer of the CPU found on this board.  It contains an
integrated A to D converter to handle much of the signal processing.
U17 is a chip that controls the reset function of the CPU during power up.  An external
connection is made to control this chip via pin 7 of connector P2, but is currently not
being used.
The CPU operates with a crystal oscillator, U6, at 11.0592 MHz.
Pull-up resistors, R67 – R72, are required for driving their respective SP control lines.
Diodes D2 and D3 are protection devices that prevent damage to the CPU in the
unlikely event that the analog and digital +5 Volt supplies do not come up together.

Diode D6 glows continuously whenever the digital +5 Volts is present, while diode D7
glows only upon the receipt of a valid command.
Jumper position, JP2, is normally open.  It is shorted only when programming the CPU
internal memory.
RS232
U11 acts as a level shifter for RS232 communications.  Jumper positions associated
with JP1 are normally shorted.  Without these connections, data associated with the
Sensor board cannot be communicated to the CPU Controller board.  Jumpers are
from pin 1 to pin 2, pin 3 to pin 4 and pin 5 to pin 6.
To change the operating program of the CPU (U10), these jumpers are removed and
a specially designed serial cable that plugs into JP1 is inserted in their place.  The
new program can then be communicated via RS232 from the computer to the chip.
To make this work, JP2 (mentioned earlier) must be shorted.
3.3.2 MONITORING CIRCUITS

Internal Temperature
U7 is a special chip with a built-in temperature sensor.  It is processed by the CPU
(U10) and passed on to the CPU Controller board as required, over the RS232
communication link.  This measurement is for the ambient temperature surrounding
the chip, or to state it another way, the general operating temperature of the
electronics.

+5 V Monitoring
Voltage divider network R32 and R35 establish a 1 volt signal that is buffered by
amplifier U20 A.  Filter circuit R27 and C57 smoothes the output and passes it on to
one of the A/D multiplexed inputs of the CPU (U10).

+12 V Monitoring
Voltage divider network R59 and R57 establish a 1.2 volt signal that is buffered by
amplifier U20 B.  Filter circuit R28 and C56 smoothes the output and passes it on to
one of the A/D multiplexed inputs of the CPU (U10).

-12 V Monitoring
U16 A circuitry is used to monitor the -12 volt supply.  Filter circuit R33 and C54
smoothes the output and passes it on to one of the A/D multiplexed inputs of the CPU
(U10).  Diode pair D11 protects the input of the A/D to keep the input from exceeding
the supply limits.
To complete the description of circuits on sheet 1 … buffer amplifier U16 B takes the
built-in voltage reference of the CPU (U10) and applies it to a voltage divider (R62,
R65, R66) and multiplexer (U26) on sheet 2.

Cablehead Voltage
The cablehead voltage circuit appears on sheet 3 of the schematic drawing.
Voltage applied to the Telemetry instrument passes through the Power Supply PC
boards and is ultimately passed on, in a filtered state, to the Sensor board via
connector P1 at pins 5 and 10 (return).
Current device U4 (chassis mounted) and Zener diode D8 supply +5 Volts of power to
the active circuit components.  This supply is isolated from the +5 Volts of the digital
circuitry.  Magnetic coupling devices U3 and U5 provide connections between the
circuit components of this CHV sensing circuit and those of the digital circuits.
Voltage divider R4 and R1 create a low voltage sample of the applied CHV and C13
provides filtering.  This sample is amplified and shifted by U1 A to create a 0 to –2.5
Volt signal at test point TP4.  Shifting is accomplished by the Reference Output of the
A/D converter (U2) and buffered by U1 B before it is applied to the summing junction of
U1 A.  Diode pair D1 protects the input of the amplifier to keep the input from
exceeding the supply limits.
Data (SDATA) is serially shifted out of the A/D using the chip select (CS) and clock
(SCLK) passing through the isolating chips U3 and U5 as mentioned previously.

+28 V Monitoring
Refer to sheet 4 of the schematic drawing to note the components involved with
monitoring the +28 V supply.
Voltage applied to the Telemetry instrument passes through the Power Supply PC
boards and creates the +28 Volts that is ultimately passed on, in a filtered state, to the
Instrument Bus for all instruments in the tool string to use.  To monitor its voltage, it is
also routed to the Sensor board via connector P1 at pins 1 and 6 (return).
Dropping resistor R30 and Zener diode D13 provide +5 Volts to the active circuit
components.  This supply is isolated from the +5 Volts of the digital circuitry.  Magnetic
coupling devices U18 and U24 provide connections between the circuit components of
this Power Supply sensing circuit and those of the digital circuits.
Voltage divider R37 and R38 create a low voltage sample of the +28 Volts and C70
provides filtering.  This sample is amplified and shifted by U22 A to create a 0 to –2.5
Volt signal at test point TP21.  Shifting is accomplished by the Reference Output of the
A/D converter (U23) and buffered by U22 B before it is applied to the summing junction
of U22 A.  Diode pair D16 protects the input of the amplifier to keep the input from
exceeding the supply limits.
Data (SDATA) is serially shifted out of the A/D using the chip select (CS) and clock

+28 V Current Monitoring
Continue to refer to sheet 4 of the schematic.
A resistor located on the Output Filter PC board (198162-000) is used as a current
sensing device.  The voltage drop across this resistor is what is used as a signal for
the +28 V Current sensing circuit.  It is routed from P2 pins 5 (-) and 10 (+) to the
Sensor board at P1 pins 2 and 3, respectively.
Dropping resistor R26 and Zener diode D10 provide +6.8 Volts to the active circuit
components.  This supply is isolated from the +5 Volts of the digital circuitry.  Opto-
coupling device U14 A provides connection between the circuit components of this
sensing circuit and those of the digital circuits.
The incoming voltage signal, proportional to the sensed current, is greatly amplified by
U12 A.  For protection, diode pair D9 is used to prevent the input from exceeding the
supply rails.  To reduce wild fluctuations in the signal, a two-pole filter is set up using
U12 B before being routed to the Voltage-to-Frequency Converter (VFC) chip of U13.
The VFC output drives the LED of the Opto-coupler U14 A.  It then passes the signal
on to the digital circuitry in the form of a frequency (at TP11).
3.3.3 SP CIRCUIT
The SP circuit is found on sheet 2 of the schematic drawing.
The SP signal is sensed at the bottom of the 1530 XA Induction instrument and passed
through the tool string until it reaches the Telemetry Sensor board at connector P2 pin
13.  Signal reference for the SP circuit is configurable either to the surface electrode
(P2 pin 14) or the cable armor (P2 pin 12).
The two amplifiers (U21 & U27) are configured identically with the SP signal applied to
the non-inverting input.  The difference is that the inverting input is tied to either the
surface electrode (U21) or to cable armor (U27).  Capacitors C62 and C71 reduce
noise on the signal and the back to back diodes prevent damage to the amplifiers in
the event that the input tries to exceed 12 Volts.
Outputs of the two amplifiers are tied to the multiplexer chip U26.  The default state
utilizes the surface electrode, so the output of U21 is applied to the first Mux input
(TP18).  Should the SP signal need to be referenced to cable armor, the second Mux
input passes the output signal of U27 (TP24).
Regardless of which signal is selected, including one of the test signals, it appears at
TP17 and is routed on to the two-pole filter circuit of U25 A.  From the output of this
filter circuit (TP23), it then is buffered by U19 (TP13) before entering the input of a 16-
bit A/D converter (U9).  Control over the A/D converter comes from the Sensor board
CPU and passes the digital data (SP_DATA) when requested, using the chip select
(SP_CS) and clock (SP_CLK) control signals.
The A/D converter, U9, uses an external +2.5 Volt reference (U8) for data conversion.
This reference is buffered by U15 A before being applied to an input of the A/D.  This

3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.1 MICROPROCESSOR,"MICROPROCESSOR
The heart of the Gamma Ray PC board is the microprocessor, U3, which controls all of
the action of the circuit.  This unique chip contains several counters, an A/D converter
and inputs/outputs necessary to handle communications.  It also has internal ROM that
contains processing firmware and internal RAM for holding data.
Support devices of the microprocessor are:
•
U7 – a 16 MHz oscillator,
•
U9 – flash memory for holding tool parameters,
•
U4 – a precision voltage reference for the A/D converter,
•
U12 – a frequency divider chip for deriving communication frequencies."
3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.2 COMMUNICATIONS,"COMMUNICATIONS
Communications with surface equipment, like other tools in the Matrix tool string, is
accomplished using Manchester words.
The Matrix Instrument Bus (MIB) carries commands for all tools of the tool string.  Only
when a command contains the correct address for a given tool does it respond.
Commands enter the Gamma Ray PC board via pins 8 and 9 of connector J1.
Commands are transformer-coupled (T2) to one of the differential amplifiers of U8.  The
output of U8 connects to the UDI pin of the Manchester Encoder/Decoder chip, U6.
Decoding commands, the Manchester chip determines whether the word is valid, and if
so, passes the 16-bit word to the microprocessor via the SDO pin.  Firmware determines
which command has been sent and what it must do to respond to that command.
If answering that command requires sending data back to the surface, the
microprocessor passes serial data to the Manchester chip for encoding on the SDI pin.
As the data word is encoded into Manchester format, it is clocked out the BZO\ and BOO\
outputs to driver chip U5.  This chip drives transformer T1 which couples the data to the
MIB.  The instrument bus data lines tie to connector J1, pins 3 and 4.  Modal
transformers within the Telemetry drive the wireline with signal levels necessary to reach
the surface."
3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.3 DETECTING PULSES,"DETECTING PULSES
As with other G/R detectors, hardware consists of a detecting crystal, coupled to a
photomultiplier (PM) tube.  Gamma rays from the formation enter the crystal where they
ionize and give off energy.  This ionization energy is converted into tiny flashes of light
(photons).  In the PM tube, these photons are changed into electrical pulses that are
amplified through a series of ten dynodes.
Voltage variations from the tube are proportional to the energy of the incident gamma
rays.  Since different levels of gamma radiation (i.e., count rates) are associated with
different types of rock, the information from the detector can be used to indicate formation

lithology.  Higher gamma ray count rates are commonly associated with the presence of
shale.
Pulses from the PM tube enter the G/R circuit at terminal J4 and are capacitor-coupled
from its high voltage source to the input of amplifier U10.  A calibrating pot (R25) adjusts
the signal strength to give a 2 V peak at TP1 when a Cesium 137 source is brought near
to the detector working with the nominal high voltage applied.
The pulses are then sent to a discriminator, U11, to eliminate base-noise and shape the
valid pulses into a square-wave signal.  It is the output of U11 that is coupled to an
internal counter of the microprocessor, U3.  Here the pulse count accumulates until the
acquisition cycle stops the counting."
3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.4 GAIN STABILIZATION,"GAIN STABILIZATION
During actual operation, increased downhole temperatures cause the gain of the
photomultiplier tube to decrease.  To keep the sensitivity of the detector to gamma rays
constant, this drop in gain must be corrected.  This correction is accomplished by
increasing the high voltage applied to the PM Tube in a quantity that is proportional to the
temperature change.  Two relationships – gain vs. temperature and gain vs. high-voltage
– are characteristic of a particular tube type and are used to stabilize the gain by means
of control loop.  Below is a discussion of the various parts of this loop.
4.4.1 TEMPERATURE SENSING
A special combination chip, U4, contains a high precision voltage reference circuit,
which is its primary function.  However, it also contains a circuit that compensates the
voltage output with variations in temperature.  The output of this circuit is available as
a voltage that is proportional to the absolute temperature (°K) that it senses.  It is this
temperature sensitive circuit’s output that is amplified at U2 A.  The output of U2 A
becomes a signal that is measured by another input of the microprocessor’s internal
A/D converter.  Firmware within the microprocessor handles the processing of the
data.  Eventually this data is sent to the surface as part of Subset 0.
4.4.2 HIGH VOLTAGE MONITOR
The next stage of the control loop monitors the high voltage.  This stage consists of
amplifier U2 B and associated components.  The amplifier ties to the lower end of the
resistive voltage divider network that biases the dynodes (also the PM tube cathode
connection) and has a gain of 10.  The output of this amplifier is fed into one of the
inputs of the A/D converter internal to the microprocessor.  Capacitor C28 is used to
provide low impedance to the A/D converter input.
4.4.3 HIGH VOLTAGE CONTROL
The High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS) is a commercial item that is housed in
modular fashion.  It has an input pin that allows circuitry to control the output voltage
level.  The HV output is inversely proportional to the voltage applied to this control

3518 XA Telemetry/GR – Circuit Descriptions
130871-945 / 3518 XA
APRIL 2004
Baker Atlas
The microprocessor uses the measured temperature to determine the proper value of
the high voltage for those conditions.  This nominal value is compared to the
measured HV value and a correction is applied if needed.  The compensation is
gradual.  This gradual change keeps the process from over-compensating and putting
the loop into a constant up-and-down pattern.
The HVPS control is derived from a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) output of the
microprocessor.  The average value of the pulse train is amplified by U1, configured
as a voltage follower, that has its positive input connected to a potentiometer.   The
network of R1, R2 and R6 establishes a limited adjustment range for the amplifier.
The amplifier output connects through resistor R3, to pin 11 of the connector J1, which
ties to the control pin of the HVPS.  Note: At room temperature, pot R2 is adjusted
until the output of the HVPS is 1300 volts.
4.4.4 START-UP
When the tool is powered up at high temperatures (i.e. downhole) the initialization
portion of the downhole software measures the tool temperature and applies an
approximate initial value to the PWM circuitry to provide for a fast turn-on.  The control
loop just described takes over from this point to keep the system gain stabilized."
3518XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.5 SELF TEST,"SELF TEST
A constant frequency of 9.766 KHz scaled down from the system crystal oscillator is fed
to a counter input of the microcontroller (pin 6).  When requested by the surface system,
these counts replace the detector counts in the tool data block.  This is a check to ensure
proper communications and basic tool functioning."

3526EB-TFMR-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.0 THEORY OF OPERATION,"THEORY OF OPERATION
The 3526 EB Focus to WTS Adapter Transformer Sub Instrument Assembly w/Alignment
Topsub provides a nominal 225 Vdc to Vin (top 27-socket female connector pins 1 and 2) on
the 3526 FB Focus to WTS Power Section Instrument Assembly. The 3526 EB and 3526 FB
must be connected together for operational use. The four transformers, full-wave bridge
rectifier, and two capacitor bank assemblies in the 3526 EB supply filtered DC voltage to the
3526 FB from nominal 180 Vac cablehead voltage.
The four transformers are connected in parallel to provide the necessary line isolation. The
full-wave bridge rectifier (BR1) converts the secondary voltage to DC and the two series
capacitor modules filter the rectified voltage. Chassis mounted 15k resistor R1 is connected
across the rectifier outputs to bleed off the charge on the capacitors modules when power is
removed.

3526EB-TFMR-AMO,Lab Safety - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION
Dangerous voltage is present on the 3526 EB Focus to WTS Adapter Transformer Sub
Instrument Assembly w/Alignment Topsub when power is applied and the pressure housing
is removed. Post the appropriate warning signs and do not leave the tool unattended when
power is on and the pressure housing is removed.
The 3526 EB weighs 112 pounds (50.8 kg) [126 pounds (57.2 kg) with thread protectors
installed]. More importantly, the tool is awkward to handle, requiring two people to lift and
carry it safely. Observe proper lifting techniques when handling this instrument.
WARNING:
POTENTIALLY LETHAL VOLTAGES ARE PRESENT IN THE
3526 EB WHEN POWER IS APPLIED. EXERCISE APPROPRIATE
CAUTION AT ALL TIMES.

AFTER POWER IS REMOVED, ALLOW A MINIMUM OF 10
SECONDS FOR CAPACITORS TO BLEED DOWN BEFORE
WORKING ON THE 3526 EB.

3526FB-ADAP-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.1 OVERVIEW ..........................................................................................................3,"OVERVIEW
The power supply uses a half-bridge switching power supply topology to convert a
nominal 250 Vdc to 28 Vdc. The half-bridge topology (see Figure 2) consists of two
alternately-conducting MOSFETs (Q1, Q2), input energy storage capacitors (C11, C14),
switched mode power transformer (T1), rectifier diodes (D1, D3), switched mode choke
(L1), and output filter capacitors (C1, C2).

conduction time (ton) of MOSFETs Q1 and Q2, which are switching at a frequency of
120 kHz (1/T). A closed loop feedback system compares Eo to a reference voltage and
adjusts the MOSFETs conduction time (ton) to maintain a constant output voltage (Eo).
For example, as Ein increases, ton decreases proportionally to maintain a constant Eo.
Mathematically, this can be written as:

Ein
Np
Ns
T
ton
Eo

=


Where:

Ein is the nominal 250-Vdc input voltage to the Power Supply

Ns/Np is the turns ratio of power transformers T1

1/T is the 120 kHz switching frequency

ton is the MOSFET’s conduction time

Eo is the regulated 28 Vdc output

3526 FB Power Section Instrument – Circuit Descriptions
Tracing through one cycle of operation, assume Q1 has been biased off and Q2 on.
Current flows from C14 through T1, C12, and Q2, applying ½ Ein across the primary
(Np) of T1. This primary voltage pulse is inductively coupled to the secondary winding
(Ns) of T1. The coupled secondary voltage forward biases diode D1, permitting
secondary current to flow through C1 and C2 and returning through L1 to the secondary
center tap of T1.
The conduction period ends when the conducting MOSFET (Q2) is commanded off, but
L1 ensures that current continue to flow to the load. Secondary current continues to flow
since the current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously. This is referred to as
the “freewheeling” period, which is the interval inductor L1 maintains the load current
until the opposite MOSFET begins conducting. Current flows from L1, through D1, D3
and returns through C1 and C2 during the “freewheeling” period.
When the opposite MOSFET (Q1) is commanded on, the “freewheeling” period ends, D3
is now forward biased, D1 is reverse biased, and current flows through C1, C2 again,
returning through L1 to the secondary center tap of T1.
The cycle repeats with the next “freewheeling” period followed by Q2 being commanded
on again. The MOSFET’s conduction time is controlled by the feedback circuitry to
maintain a constant 28-Vdc output in spite of the varying load and Ein.

Voltage mode PWM (Pulse Width Modulator) Controller U1 provides the nucleus for the
converter control circuitry that consists of an error amplifiers, clock, PWM circuitry, and
shutdown circuitry.
Converter switching frequency is set by the PWM’s clock, which operates at twice the
switching frequency. Components R16, C19, and C20 set the oscillator frequency and
dead time. The PWM’s Sync signal (pin 10) is used on the Output Filter PCB. U8 and
U9 A buffer the signal (CLKOUT) before it is transformer coupled (T3) to the Output
Filter PCB.
Control of the MOSFET conduction time is accomplished with PWM circuitry internal to
U1. The PWM circuitry functions by comparing the error voltage at U1, pin 5 with a
ramp signal synchronized with the PWM’s clock. Q3 buffers the ramp signal, which is
then applied to U1, pin 4. The PWM circuitry provides a duty-cycle-modulated waveform
that is alternately directed to DRVA and DRVB. Figure 4 shows the PWM (U1)
waveforms.

DRVA and DRVB of U1 are buffered by high-speed MOSFET driver ICs U2 and U4. U2

Q2, on and off. Dual secondary transformer T1 provides the necessary high side/low side
drive capability required for the Half-Bridge topology. Resistors R4 and R15 serve to
control Q1 and Q2 turn-on gate current and dampen ringing at the gate. Components R2,

3526FB-ADAP-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.3 SOFT START .......................................................................................................8,"SOFT START
Soft start (SS) is a controlled start-up process that reduces stress on the Power Supply
components and minimizes output overshoot during start-up. Soft start is accomplished
by controlling the rate at which the voltage on pin 1 (C/S SS) of the PWM IC (U1)
ramps-up, which in turn controls Vout’s rise time. The controlled start-up is provided by
the time constant provided by R53 and C62. The voltage across C62 is buffered by U11
and drives the PWM’s C/S SS pin. Note that the 28 volt output takes ~160 ms to reach
full output. Figure 6 shows the soft-start waveforms at power-up.
When Power Supply operation is inhibited (PSEN =0 ), Run is held low by holding
transistors Q5 and Q8 on, which keep C62 discharged such that Soft start = 0. When
PSEN = 1, Run goes high and turns off Q5 and Q8, which allows the voltage on C62 to
start increasing exponentially, allowing Vout to start ramping up. Comparator-generated
signals SSRST/ and SSCMP indicate SS status. Signal SSRST/ is low when C62 is fully
discharged and conversely SSCMP=1 when SS is complete. These signals control the SS
process when HCL (high current limit) goes high. Under a sustained HCL condition, SS
is invoked and the signals force each SS cycle to terminate before the next cycle starts.

Waveform 3 = SSCMP (U14-6)

The demodulated error voltage provided by the Output Filter PCB is received via the
Sense+ and Sense– lines. Choke T2 provides common-mode filtering and the
demodulated error voltage is buffered by a differential amplifier consisting of U3 and
associated components. The buffered error voltage (VERROR) is applied through an RC
network to pin 5 (E/A+) of the PWM U1. Internal to U1, the error voltage is compared to
the voltage ramp on U6, pins 4. This comparison produces the ton pulse that is alternately
connected to A Out or B Out of U1. As previously discussed, a change in Eo is detected
by the control-loop circuitry and the circuit adjusts ton proportionately to correct Eo.

Current transformer T4 samples the current pulses, delivered by Q1 and Q2 to the
primary of transformer T1 to provide over-current protection. The primary current is used
to detect output overload conditions since the primary current is equal to the secondary
current reflected by Np/Ns. Components R22, D3, and D4 convert the bipolar current
pulse to a unipolar voltage pulse. Components R21, R23, C71 and C21 serve to divide
and filter the signal prior to applying it to U7 and U13, which are the over current
detection comparators. Transistor Q4, IC U6, and associated components blank the
leading edge current spike, on R22, to prevent false over-current limiting.
The two comparators provide two levels of over current protection. If the overload is
20% or greater, only LCL current limit is invoked (Figure 8). If the overload is 40% or
greater, The HCL current limit is invoked, the output is temporarily removed, and a soft-

RC snubbers (R1 – R3, R5, R28, R29, C11, C18, and C35) across each rectifier diode and
transformer secondary dampen rectifier turn-on ringing, which is caused by the resonance
of the rectifier’s junction capacitance and the transformer’s secondary leakage
inductance. 

HOUSEKEEPING POWER SUPPLY
The housekeeping power supply (HKPS) is a two transistor Flyback Switching Power
Supply that is controlled by a Si9120 PWM IC. Operation is similar to the previously
discussed PWM circuitry in that the MOSFET’s conduction time is modulated to
maintain a constant output voltage.
The voltage ramp required for PWM is provided by capacitor C53 charging through
resistors R45 and R59, with diode D16 serving to reset the ramp after each cycle. Output
over-current protection is provided by resistor R13 and diode D20.
For regulation purposes, the 15 Vdc is fed back through R12 and R17; with C21, C25,
and R11 setting the loop gain.
Resistor R6 sets the PWM’s switching frequency to 200 kHz, while resistor R16
establishes the PWM’s bias current. Output pin 5 of the PWM drives the two MOSFETs
concurrently, each through its own DC restoration circuit (C23, D19, R56, C17, D13, and
R53). Energy is stored in T1’s air gap while transistors Q2 and Q1 are conducting.
During the conduction interval, diode D1 is reverse biased. When Q1 and Q2 are turned
off, energy stored in T1 is released, D1 is forward biased, and the output capacitors (C6-
C15, C46, and C47) are charged. During the conduction interval, when D1 is reversed
biased, energy stored in the output capacitors maintains the 15-Vdc output.
Start-up power is provided to the PWM through diode D12 and resistor R3. Once the
HPS commences operation, PWM operating power is supplied from the 15-Vdc output
via components D4, R45, D5, D9, and D10.

MICRO-COMPUTER CONTROLLER
The PIC16 F873 (U5) is an 8-bit microcontroller with an internal 10-bit A/D and data
EEPROM. Chip U6 and related components translate CHV to a 0 Vdc to 5 Vdc signal
(ACHV) that is compatible with U5. Likewise, U10 and related components translate
temperature dependent current from the chassis-mounted AD590 (U1) to a signal
(ATEMP) that is compatible with U5. Chip U8 permits monitoring of the 15-Vdc
supplied by the HKPS.
Power Supply Enable (PSEN) and Over Current Reset (OCR) are output command lines
to the controller PCB. A logic high from PSEN turns on the 28-Vdc output and OCR
resets a latch internal to U16 on the controller PCB.
Latched Output under Voltage (LOUV), Latched Output Over-voltage (LOOV), and
Latched Over current (LOC) are 28-Vdc output status signals sent back from U16 on the
controller PCB. The status of these signals is saved in the microcontroller’s EEPROM for
diagnostic purposes.

3526 FB Power Section Instrument – Circuit Descriptions
The microcontroller monitors cable-head voltage, chassis temperature, and housekeeping
voltage to ensure these parameters are within limits before enabling the 28 Vdc power
supply. Once the 28 Vdc power supply is enabled, the microcontroller continues
monitoring the three parameters and will disable the power supply if any fall out-of-
range.
The typical ON/OFF set points determined by the microcontroller are:
•
Input voltage set points:
o Turn – ON:
225 Vdc < Vch < 300 Vdc
o Turn – OFF: Vch < 160 Vdc or Vch > 330 Vdc
•
Over-Temperature set points are as follows:
o Power Supply OFF: Chassis temperature equal or greater than 175º C
o Power Supply ON:
Chassis temperature 170º C or less
•
Vcc set points
o Power Supply ON:
14 Vdc < Vcc < 16 Vdc
When the cable-head voltage or chassis temperature goes out of range, the micro-
controller disables the power supply and waits for these conditions to fall within range
again before restarting the power supply. The micro-controller behaves slightly
differently to Vcc. If Vcc drifts out of range while the power supply has been enabled, the
PIC PCB will permanently disable the power supply. In this situation, the micro-
controller must be reset by cycling the housekeeping voltage (i.e., lower the cable-head
voltage below 150 Vac).
The PIC PCB monitors three power supply status signals (LOC, LOUV, LOOV) while
the 28 Vdc power supply is enabled. The PIC PCB will record any change in the state of
these signals in its internal EEPROM. The PIC PCB will permanently disable the power
supply if the LOOV signal is asserted, indicating an over-voltage condition on the 28-
Vdc bus. Similar to a Vcc out-of-range condition, the micro-controller must be reset to
exit this condition.
LED D14 provides an indication of the microcontroller’s state. The LED blinks at a rate
of twice per second when the micro-controller is holding the 28-Vdc power supply off
and waiting for cable-head voltage, chassis temperature, and Vcc to fall in range. Once
the 28-Vdc power supply has been turned on, the PIC PCB will leave the LED on
continuously. The LED will blink at a rate of once per second when the PIC PCB
permanently disables the power supply in the event that Vcc is out-of-range or that
LOOV is asserted.
Jumper JP1 is a 10-pin header used to connect the PIC PCB to a PC for diagnostic
purposes. Four shunts are installed across the jumper when the diagnostic port is not in
use.
Header P3 is used for in-circuit programming and debugging. J2 is a jumper with a shunt
that is removed only during in-circuit programming of the micro-controller. The shunt
needs to be installed for normal operation of the board.

180 Vac from a WTS Telemetry the 28 Vdc used by the Focus instrument string. AC voltage
is received by the 3526 EB and a DC voltage in the range of 160 Vdc to 330 Vdc is provided
to the 3526 FB. Although the operating range of the 3526 FB is 160 Vdc to 330 Vdc, an input
of at least 225 Vdc to start. This input voltage provides the necessary hysteresis to ensure that
the input does not drop below 160 Vdc, due to the voltage drop in the cable as the power
supply comes up.

3590XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.0 OVERVIEW,"OVERVIEW
The primary function of the 3590 XA Wireline Telemetry (WTS Common Remote) is to act as a
wireline repeater of the telemetry channels and to create the WTS Instrument Bus (WTS-IB). The
3590 XA Wireline Telemetry does not interpret or take any action with commands that are targeted
to other instruments of the tool string. This is also true for the data that is sent to the surface from
these tools.  A secondary function is to acquire data from several internal sensors and/or optional
external sensors.

Downhole Telemetry Interface
The 3590 XA HTHP Wireline Telemetry (WTS Common Remote) was developed to provide
downhole telemetry in High Temperature and High Pressure boreholes. It also provides improved
long-line performance when using wireline greater than 20,000 feet and up to 40,000 feet in
length.

Internal Temperature Sensors
Refer to Drawing A3000659 SCH, Figure 1, and wiring diagram A3000659 WRD.

temperature measures Zone 3 temperature and is exposed directly to the borehole environment.
The temperature is measured via a sensor in the 2890 XB. The electronics for this sensor are
located on the Sensor board and explained in Section 4.7.
The electronics flask internal temperature (Zone 1) is monitored by U2 located on the A/D &
Controller board (A3001573000) and is explained in Section 2.2.2. The temperature outside the
electronics flask yet inside the housing flask (Zone 2) is monitored by RTD2 located on the
power supply chassis (A3000659 SCH). Electronics associated with RTD2 are on the sensor
board (F129982000) Channel 9 Section 4.6. Both of these temperatures are read and sent to the
surface while logging.
The third temperature sensor, RTD1, is also located inside the housing flask (Zone 2) on the
power supply chassis in close proximity to RTD2 and is connected directly to Top sub pins 26
and 10. This “passive” arrangement is read by connecting a hand held meter to the top sub. The
measurement provides the operator with the internal temperature, so he can determine if the
temperature is low enough that the housing can be safely removed.

3590XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.0 CONTROLLER AND DATA ACQUISITION BOARD,"CONTROLLER AND DATA ACQUISITION BOARD
Refer to assembly drawing A3001573000 and schematic A3001573 SCH during the circuit
discussions of the Controller and Data Acquisition board.
This board is divided into two major sections. The circuit on the right half of the board is the
controller section, the remainder of the board comprises the data acquisition section.

Controller Section
This microcontroller based circuit performs the following functions:
•
Interface directly to the Manchester chip (U19) to receive the serial data, interpret and
execute commands and serial data from Manchester encoding and transmission.
•
Control the sequence of the data acquisition process and the gathering of data from the A/D.
•
All instrument relays and switches are energized, latched, or switched by the controller and
its associated driver circuits.
In addition to the functions noted above, a test socket is provided on board, but is NOT FOR
FIELD USE.
2.1.1 Power-On Reset
Upon power up, the microcontroller or MCU (U18) is held reset by R27 and C11 for a period of
three seconds. The long time constant was chosen to allow the correct startup under various
conditions of instrument power-up, particularly when the variac voltage is turned up very slowly.
D4 across R27 allows rapid discharge of the reset circuit when the instrument is de-energized. D9
protects U18’s reset pin from negative overshoot and balances out the leakage of D4 at
temperature.
2.1.2 Clock Oscillator
A crystal clock oscillator package (U16) supplied a 4 MHz clock to the MCU. The MUC divides
the clock by 2 internally and runs at 2 MHz with a period of 0.5 µs.
Observe that U16 has built in divider stages with outputs supplied to other parts of the system.
One of these outputs is the 7812.5-Hz clock at pin 1 of U16. This clock is buffered by a dedicated
gate (U15), to provide a constant amplitude square wave to the mud resistivity circuit. Regulation
is made possible by deriving the +5 V power supply for U15 from a precision voltage reference in
the data acquisition section rather that using the main logic supply. The buffered output is made
available at the terminal labeled 7812.5 Hz.

2.1.3 Manchester Interface
Like other instruments in the WTS system, the 3590 common remote has its own designated
remote terminal address, which is $80 in this case. However, with both repeater and local remote
residing in the same package, there is no need to interface its local remote to the instrument bus.
Instead, the UDI and BZO/ signals of the Manchester (U19) tap directly into the repeater via logic
elements, and this eliminate the two coupling transformers, receiver, driver, and passive
components normally used in a typical remote.
Interface between U19 and the MCU (U18) is straight forward. Nine of the MCU’s I/O ports are
configured for direct handshaking with the Manchester chip (U19).
R28 keeps the Manchester encoder disabled during the brief power-up cycle to avoid unwanted
transmission to the surface.
R29 combines SDI and TD signals to save one MCU port, because the two signals are not
required to be active simultaneously.
R33 is a special case pull-down resistor.
2.1.4 Relay Interface
There are four latching relays in the 3590, one of which, is located in the controller section of this
board and is used for SP and bridle switching. The other three relays are located on the mud
resistivity board and used for mode switching. There is a non-latching power relay (K1) mounted
on the chassis for motor supply and other signal routing. All of these relays can operate with a
24 V supply.
A separate 24 V power supply is derived from the unregulated inputs of the ±15 V regulators; i.e.,
V+ and V-. The common return is floating in this supply, with V- used as the return. The power
supplies deliver a fairly stable voltage when properly powered. Zener diode (D6) develops 18 V
across it leads, leaving 24 volts to power the relays. C12 provides additional filtering.
Although local conditions vary widely as one or more relays are switched in different
combinations, this arrangement provides adequate regulation. The steady state current is low
because only K1 requires current to hold it energized. Pulse duration for the latching relays is 10
µs.
Darlington array (U22) with its built-in EMP protection diodes provides the drive to the
individual coils. Shift-and-store register (U21) supplies the control signals at its latched outputs to
U22. Data from the MCU is clocked serially into U21, while latched outputs of U21 are held

Circuit Description
3590 XA HTHP WTS Telemetry
131034-945
JULY 2010

Interface between the +5 V logic control signals and the relay driver circuit is accomplished by a
voltage level translation circuit. Obviously, doing the translation at the three input lines of U21
instead of the outputs required fewer components. For this reason, U21 must be powered by a net
5 V supply, which is developed across Zener diode D5 with Vss = -15 V and VDD = -10 V. This is
an important detail to keep in mind when servicing the circuit. PNP transistor array (U20) and
resistors R20 through R25 accomplish the translation.
2.1.5 Other Switches
When not AC motoring, conductor 7 of the wireline can be used for transmitting the mode 7 C
channel. The channel is transformer-coupled by T6 to the wireline. T6 is AC-coupled to keep
from interfering with SP and DLL remotes on conductor 7 (in Mode 7 state). U17 is a CMOS
switch with a low 25 ohm-on resistance. It is configured in the circuit as dual SPDT switches
connected in parallel, thus dropping the on-resistance to one-half the noted value.
The MCU controls U17 directly. In one setting, line 7 gets connected to the SP conductor to
provide the SP signal uphole. In the other setting, line 7 becomes connected to line 13 of the
instrument bus below the 3590 and acts as a DLL surface reference. It may also be used as an
analog signal path to the surface by some instruments if the need arises. L4 filters mode 7 C
signals out of the downhole SP signal.
2.1.6 Diagnostic Interface
A test socket is installed on the PC board, but is NOT FOR FIELD USE.
2.1.7 Data Acquisition Interface
By far, this interface is the largest user of I/O ports, 15 in all. These are divided into four


Data Acquisition Section
2.2.1 Overview
The data acquisition circuit accommodates a wide dynamic range, bipolar operation, and accuracy
of measurement. Refer to the 3590 XA subset documentation for additional information
concerning the application of converted data. Further information on each channel is described in
the Sensor board discussion.
A brief highlight of the configuration follows:
•
Basic Converter – Industry standard 574 A/D chip, operated in the bipolar mode for 12-bit
resolution and with a 0 – to 10 V input range.
•
Other Features –
Two-step auto-gain -ranging scale:
1)
Gain of 2 for input signals exceeding about 600 mV
2)
Gain of 15 for signals below 600 mV

Separate sign bit for bipolar signals

Track and hold amplifier

External precision 10 V reference for calibration

16 data channels with ±5 V input range

First two for dedicated drift corrections
2.2.2 Analog Channel Multiplexer
As shown on the schematic, U3 and U4 form the 16-channel analog multiplexer. All but three
input terminals are wired to signal channels outside the board. Channel 1 is an A/D Zero
reference. Channel 2 is a 580 mV A/D Cal reference, derived from the precision 10 V output of
U1 by a voltage divider network R1, R2, and R3. The third channel represents the flask
temperature (10 mV / ºC and is supplied by U2, a single package, voltage output, temperature
sensor. The three terminals, connected locally on board, serve as test points.
Channel selection is controlled by four MCU output ports: three directly address one of eight
channels in each multiplexer and a forth (pin 8 of U18) is the enable control line for U3 and
U4.The enable signal routed through U8 generates an enable and it’s complement to exclusively

JULY 2010
2.2.3 Sign Converter
The selected analog output, buffered by one of the dual op-amps in U5, passes through a
switchable sign converter made up of the second op-amp in U5, resistors R8, R9, and R10 and
one half of the analog switches in U10. When a positive signal is available at both inputs of this
amplifier, U5 acts as a voltage follower with a gain of 1, independent of the gain resistor ratios.
For negative signals, the switch disconnects the non-inverting input from the signal, grounding it
through R10 to form an inverting amplifier with a gain of -1. This signal at the output of U5 will
always be positive except possibly during a small window around the zero-crossing threshold for
switching. Precision resistors R8 and R9 assure a negative unity gain, while a 30 mV nominal
offset in the succeeding stage adds to the signal to make it positive all the time to satisfy the
converter’s unipolar input requirements.
Such offset, conveniently introduced at the track and hold amplifier (U9) by biasing it trim inputs,
must be accounted for after data recovery, together with any other offset and gain drift errors. The
method involves multiple sampling of the ZERO and CAL channels under different gain and sign
settings. Hence for the channels, the MCU overrides the free running auto-gain, auto-sign
operations periodically as will be described later. For other signals, sign control is accomplished
by comparator 2 of U7, which monitors the buffered analog signal in reference to zero.
A comparator offset, if large enough, can shift the zero point beyond the allowable 30 nV
window, leading to erratic sign results. The signal into the first comparator is boosted 10 X by a
low offset amplifier (op-amp 2 of U6) to eliminate the need for a null trim pot. In effect, any
comparator offset would then seem reduced by the same factor (compared to the input signal of
interest) in the vicinity of the zero-crossing region.
Back-to-back Zener diodes D1 and D2 protect U7 by limiting the boosted signal range to safe
values. The sign bit formed at the output of the comparator must be read with the data after
conversion. Its logic level must be the same immediately before and after conversion to eliminate
the possibility of coding the wrong sign with the converted data. The output of the comparator
itself is not restricted. The output through R12 is OR-tied at pin 3 of U8 with another sign control
signal from the MCU. Pin 3 is the input of one of the two latches enabled by a second MCU
control signal (pin 7 of U18). When enabled, the output of the latch (pin 15 of U8) follows the
logic state of pin 3. This is the case during the signal tracking period in the data acquisition cycle,
where the latch output dynamically controls the inverter. The comparator output is granted control
when the MCU floats its output to a high impedance state. At other times, the MCU may bring its

2.2.4 Gain Ranging and Track / Hold
Comparator one in the dual unit package (U7) generates the gain bit. It compares the signal at the
output of the sign inverter with VTH. The set point VTH was made higher that the 580 mV CAL to
trip the comparator output high when CAL is sampled. The desired outcome is a gain of 16. The
reasoning for this gain will be explained later in this discussion.
Another gain bit control line from the MCU is OR-tied with the output of the comparator through
D3 and R14 to allow either gain bit to appear at the input of the controlled latch (pin 2 of U8).
The latch output at pin 16 is the Gain Ranging control signal that actually switches the gain at pin
10 of U10, and it is read with the converted data. This latch and the sign bit latch have a single
enable line controlled by the MCU signal (pin 17 of U18) mentioned earlier. Incidentally, the
same MCU signal controls the enable line of a second latch in U8 at pin 4. The latch holds the
CCL gain bit generated at the sensors board steady during the conversion cycle.
The MCU can grant gain-ranging control to the comparator by bringing its output to a high logic
state. In the calibration cycle, it can force the gain bit low only for a gain of two, unlike the sign
case. Indirectly, however, the gain can be made 16 for both ZERO and CAL by default under
comparator control. What makes this possible is that the two signals fall below the comparator
threshold point VTH.
Resistors R15, R16, and R17 form a feedback network around U9 that is selectable by analog
switches in U10 for a gain of 2 or 16. U9 doubles in function as a track and hold amplifier. It
constantly track the signal present at its input and holds it constant before the conversion cycle
starts on command from the MCU.
2.2.5 Data Conversion and Encoding
The A/D (U11) is configured to convert and provide all 12-bits at its outputs simultaneously when
initiated with a single control pulse at pin 5. The digital data plus four other binary signals are
multiplexed into four nibbles by data selectors U12 and U13. The MCU uses a two-bit “Nibble
Select Bus” to read each nibble onto its 4-bit data bus as shown on schematic A3001573 SCH.
A third data selector (U14) is controlled by the same MCU port associated with gain ranging;
however, it has nothing to do with gain ranging. The Manchester word can accommodate only 16
bits. Out of those 16-bits, 12 are occupied by the converted data and one by the gain bit, which
leaves three bits. The SP channel requires that a 3-bit code be transmitted with the data. One of
the bit lines, B2, is permanently wired for MSB in the 16-bit word while the remaining two, B0
and B1, are routed to U14. The SP sign is applied positive and it is not transmitted. In this case,
U14 selects the two code bits to fill the data word.
In another special case, applicable to the CCL channel, a unique CCL gain bit must be
transmitted. Here, U14 select that bit and the sign bit for transmission. It also retains this selection
for other channels, excluding the SP channel of course.

Refer to assembly drawing F191663000 and schematic F191663100 during the circuit
discussions of the repeater board.
While other boards in the 3590 perform needed functions and gather a multitude of data channels
vital to the logging service, the repeater card is essential to WTS operation. It forms the link
between the surface panel, via modal transmission on the wireline, and downhole instruments
communicating on the instrument bus. The three modal transformers that couple signals between
the board and the line are mounted on the backbone of the power supply section.
Functionally, the board’s circuit is subdivided into four channels: Command, Mode 2, mode 5,
and Mode 7.

Command Channel
This channel receives Manchester words from the surface panel and repeats the words on the
command bus. Words can be commands or data as determined by the Manchester Sync bit. A
standard defining the shape and polarity of the signals used in the WTS transmission system has
been specified.
Signals entering the command channel at the 20 kb/s rate of the surface to downhole transmission
are amplified and inverted by op-amp 1 of U1. Gain pot P1 adjusts the signal level to suit the
length, type, and condition of the wireline in service. Ideally, the signal should be about 8 to 10
volts p-p as measured at the CMP IN test terminal.
Mode 2 channel couples the mode 2 winding on the same modal transformer connected to the
command channel. The induced command signal in this winding is fed to the non-inverting input
of differential amplifier U1, effectively increasing the signal strength and improving the signal to
noise ratio. On the other hand, data words on the mode 2 channel coupled back into the command
channel are undesirable and are attenuated by this echo cancellation arrangement.
A cascaded RC filter followed by the equalization filter implemented in the second op-amp of U1
reduces the noise and harmonic distortion added to the signal by the wireline.
In the 3514 XB, R6 A is replaced with a band-pass filter on board F191658000. U1 gain resistors
are selected to obtain the overall system response.
Comparator U2 converts the signal to digital form, triggering at approximately a ±2 volt
hysteresis established by its resistor network. The trigger reference at the non-inverting input of
the comparator flips from one level to another as the output of the comparator changes state and
feeds back into R10 at pin 15 of the programmable logic device (U5). R47 trims R11 to center the
trigger point around the signal baseline. This centering adjustment removes timing skew in the
signal edges and improves communication. The feedback, gated by an AND gate in U5, is
inhibited during data transmission on mode 2. Pin 15 of U5 is forced low during this period to
reset the comparator to a predetermined state. There are two reasons for this action: first to
prevent mode 2 data, induced in the command channel, from reaching the instrument bus where it

may be interpreted as a command word. Second, to prepare the comparator to trigger on the first
edge of the next command sync. Otherwise, the comparator may already be in that state and fail
to repeat the correct sync on the instrument bus. The comparator state would have been dependent
on the ending bit in the preceding mode 2 data transmission.
The comparator reset signal is generated by a retriggerable one shot implemented inside U5. Its
192 µs timing period allows the one shot to stay triggered while mode 2 data bits are present,
even during the longer sync period.
The command interrupt bus is coupled to the command channel by T1. the transformer is driven
by differential line driver U3 with its open collector outputs pulled high at the center tap through
the diodes and current limiting resistors. One of the U3 inputs is driven directly by the
comparator. The remaining input is connected to the complemented comparator output at U5.
The local 3590 CR Manchester decoder receives the command signal at its UDI input from the
gated comparator output (pin 15 of U5). D1 keeps a damaging -15 V from appearing at UDI if U5
is not inserted.

Mode 2 Channel
Receives Mode 2 data, processes it, filters it, and sends it up the wireline on mode 2.
Reliable reception of data at the other end of the wireline requires that the Manchester-encoded
logic level signal (0 V, 5 V) be modified for transmission. The transmission is designed to put
shaped, filtered bipolar pulses on the wireline. This process limits the bandwidth required for a
transmission, reduces line charging, and reduces crosstalk to the other data channels. All the data
and clocking information encoded in a Manchester signal is represented in the transition of the
logic-level signal. Narrow pulses are generated by the transitions as will be seen in the following
description.
At the front end of the receiver, data enters from two separate sources before being OR-tied and
shaped digitally within U5. One source is the Manchester BZO/ output of the local remote. BZO/
interfaces directly to pin 2 of U5. The other is the instrument bus coupled through T2 to one of
the differential receivers in U4. The output of U4 is connected to pin 11 of U5. The two merged
signals inside U5 form a single Mode 2 data path, which is processed as follows:
First, a logic level change in the merged Mode 2 Data in U5 initiated a positive pulse at one of
two corresponding outputs M2 H (pin 9) and M2 L (pin 10). In turn, that enables a counter
incremented by a 4 MHz reference clock. When the count reaches a predetermine number, the
counter toggles a flip-flop ending the pulse and clearing itself. In the 3590, if the time after the
previous pulse has been long, M2 H or M2 L will appear at pin 18 (N2 H_short) or pin 20
(M2 L_short) instead.
The pulse width generated on Mode 2 is 5.125 µs ±0.125 µs. the uncertainty is due to the variable
time difference between the data transition edge and the first clocking edge of the 4 MHz clock.
This one-count jitter amounts to less than 5% and translates into periodic, slight amplitude
modulation in the filtered signal output. The frequency beating is nonexistent on data emanating

JULY 2010

Second, the data pulses emanating from pins 9/18 and 10/20 of U5 are fed into the inputs of a
unity gain differential amplifier made up of op-amp 2 in U5 and six resistors. The op-amp
provides unity gain for signals from U5, pins 9 and 10, but reduced gain (shorted amplitude) for
signals from U5, pins 18 and 20. The amplifier passes the pulses at its non-inverting input and
inverts the pulses at the outer input, converting the two-level signal (0 V, 5 V) to a five-level (-V, -
short, +short, +V) alternate mark inversion (AMI) signal. This AMI signal is passed through a
two-pole low-pass Bessel filter (op-amp 1 in U6) to remove the high-frequency edges. The
shaped and filtered signal is put on the wireline through the Mode 2 coupling transformer,
capacitively driven by the current buffer (U7).
For lower power dissipation in the current driver, the output stage of this hybrid device is
powered with ±12 V. The voltages are obtained by dropping the ±15 V supplies through 3.0-volt
Zener diodes D5 and D6.

Mode 5 Channel
This channel receives data only from Mode 5 of the instrument bus. It has a higher bit rate (93.75
kb/s) as specified in the WTS specification. Being coupled to the wireline through a separate
modal transformer, feedback into the command channel is negligible. No comparator controls are
required.
The instrument bus coupling transformer has a higher frequency response than the ones used for
lower speed, Mode 2 channels. The differential input circuits are similar to that of Mode 2, as is
the shaping circuit of U9, which generates narrower pulses in a proportional manner. Using an 8
MHz clock, the jitter remains below 5% for this channel also.
The other stages are practically the same as those for the previous channel with the exception of
the filter circuit. A single pole RC filter is sufficient for this channel.

Mode 7 Channel
This channel works at the same speed as the mode 5 channel. On the wireline side, the circuit is
transformer-coupled (T6) through a capacitor (C7) and relay (K1) to line 7 and the center tap of
the Mode 5 transformer. On the instrument bus side, the interface connects to Mode 7 A. The
circuit for both modes is similar, sharing the same dual receiver package (U8) and dual shaping
sections implemented in U9. U9 consumes about 30 mA when running at 8 MHz speed.

3590XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 4.0 SENSOR BOARD,"SENSOR BOARD
Refer to assembly drawing F129982000 and schematic F129982100 during the circuit
discussions of the sensor board.
The sensor board is a collection of independent circuits on a single board. The board processes
and/or filters a dozen analog channels in preparation for sampling. It also receives the system’s
precision 10 V reference for the controller and data acquisition board to provide a buffered, stable,
bridge supply for the force gauge and pressure sensors. Other references required for same of the
sensor circuits are derived form the 10 V reference as well.
To a large extent, all circuits are physically partitioned for ease of layout, identification, and
servicing. The channels are labeled from 4 through 15 and are positioned on the board in a
sequential order from left to right. The same order will be followed in describing these circuits.

Channel 4 (Ax)
Unused filter Ax. See CH6 circuit description. Op-amp U1 is not installed.

Channel 5 (Ay)
Unused filter Ay. See filter description below. Op-amp U2 is not installed.

Channel 6 (Ax)
Each filter circuit in the above three channels consists of a 2-pole low-pass Bessel filter having a
role-off frequency of 2 Hz. It is a classic two-stage two-pole design with parameters yielding an
overall gain of 1.906. Op-amp U3 is not installed.
A one megohm pull-down resistor at the input of each circuit keeps it from floating in the absence
of a signal source.


Channel 7 (Force)
Gain and filter circuit for the force strain gauge sensor. The tension/compression load cell in the
sensor sub delivers about a 1 mV signal per 1,000 lbf, based on the 10 V of excitation used. The
force scale required in tension is 20,000 lbf, and is much less in compression. A ±20 mV input
range specification covers both scales equally, but with the positive polarity implying tension.
Input instrumentation amplifier U4 has a gain of 201. the resulting full-scale signal will be
approximately ±4.0 V, well within the ±5 V input range of the data conversion section.
A 2-pole low-pass filter following the gain stage rolls off the signal (-3 dB) at about 6 Hz.
Resistor at the input of the amplifier keep the output from saturating when the sensor sub is
installed. Input capacitor C53 filters high-frequency noise on the input lead wires.

Channel 8 (Caliper)
This channel processes the caliper signal. The circuit is similar to that for channel 7. U6 has a
gain of 1, with no connections between pins 1 and 4. R33 and R34 together with R92 form a
divide-by-three attenuator similar to the caliper input in the 3506 PCM and 3516 SLAM adapter.
R93 works with C54 to provide additional high-frequency noise filtering. R93 is also a dropping
resistor for the input protection Zeners. This circuit protects the input of top block #2 if
accidentally installed with the 3590 below the 4431 XA power adapter.

Channel 9 (Zone 2 Flask Temperature)
This circuit is used to recover the Zone 2 flask temperature from RTD2
A constant current source, implemented using differential amplifier U10, drives the RTD2. The
signal developed across the sensor is amplified by U11. C18, in the feedback loop, filters any
high-frequency noise past the 11 Hz roll-off frequency.
Offset and scale adjustments were avoided in this circuit, and channel 9’s accuracy relies on the
precision of the components used. A formula derived in terms of output voltage is solved for
temperature. A 1000 ohm RTD with an alpfa = 0.00385 is mounted on the power supply chassis;
consequently, the gain of the output amplifier is set to 5 by the ratio of resistors R38 and R37.

Channel 10 (Borehole Temp)
A constant current source, implemented using differential amplifier U10, drives the RTD. The
signal developed across the sensor is amplified by U11. C18, in the feedback loop, filters any
high-frequency noise past the 11 Hz roll-off frequency.
Offset and scale adjustments were avoided in this circuit, and channel 10’s accuracy relies on the
precision of the components used. A formula derived in terms of output voltage is solved for
temperature. A 500 ohm RTD with an alpfa = 0.00385 is in the sensor sub; consequently, the gain
of the output amplifier is set to 5 by the ratio of resistors R41 and R42.

Channel 11 (Unused TA)
This is an unused buffer channel. The circuit is simply a buffer for an AD590 temperature sensor
with a 10k scale resistor. At the time of this manual’s publication, no signal input is connected to
terminal TA.
The other half of U12 is used in the load cell excitation circuit.

Voltage References
Next in line on the card, one inverter attenuator circuit (half of U13) scales down the precision
10 V reference input to generate a -1.35 V reference for channels 9, 10, 12, and 13. the second op-
amp in U13 inverts this reference to obtain the positive complement +1.35 V, though only
channels 12 and 13 require it.
Q1, acting as a current buffer at the output of op-amp U12, supplies the necessary current to
power the force and/or pressure gauges. The driver and sensor lines become connected remotely
inside the sensor sub when it is installed. The closed loop formed around U12 maintains a precise
10 V excitation voltage at the load cell bridge. R43 keeps the loop closed if the load is
disconnected. It has a large value so that it will not interfere with the normal sensing operation.
4.10 Channel 12 (CCL)
Channel 12 focuses on the CCL signal. It is desirable to preserve the shape and polarity of the
waveform when digitizing the CCL pulse. This generally requires higher sampling rates . the
multisampling capabilities of ECLIPS makes it feasible to achieve this result, as the circuit does
not employ any peak detectors.
The level of CCL signal can span a wide dynamic range because of the large magnetic fields
encountered and more than one type of CCL subs that may be adapted for use with the WTS
system.
Normally, the measurement is not intended for cased hole operations with flush joints, but the

The signal received on conductors 16 and 10 of the upper instrument bus is passively filtered by
the input RC stage leading to instrumentation amplifier U14. D1 and D2 protect the device from
peaks exceeding ±12 V. Additional filtering is done by the 2-pole active filter around op-amp U15
for an overall flat response up to about 4 Hz. From there, the signal splits entering a window
comparator and a two-step scale adjustment circuit encompassing the second op-amp in U15 and
analog switch U17. The output of the comparator, CCL GB, is latched on the controller and A/D
board before data conversion and the latched output, Q2, controls the scale. For signals outside
the range of ±80 mV the window comparator selects the node between R58 and R59 as the
feedback path to the inverting amplifier. In this case, the circuit behaves as an attenuator, stepping
down the input voltage by a factor of 2.5 to accommodate signals approaching the ±12 V level.
Signals within the ±80 mV level set the comparator in the opposite logic state, boosting the gain
from 0.4 to 48. The set point references defining the window were chosen low enough to provide
adequate tolerance to any offset at high gain and temperature.
The latched comparator output representing the gain status is transmitted with the data as a CCL
Gain Bit.
D8 and D9 protect the comparator inputs (U16) from over-voltage. R88 prevents D8 and D9 from
clamping the CCL signal at the output of U15 and also limits the input current to the comparator.
4.11 Channel 13 (SP)
Auxiliary measurement of the SP signal, in reference to armor, is performed by this channel using
an instrument electrode or the lower bridle. The low-level SP signal must be amplified to improve
resolution of the received signal. Yet, the inherent offset associated with the SP can quickly
saturate the amplifier. The practice with the surface reference SP has been to add a pot on a panel
to null out the constantly changing SP offset.
Tailored for downhole operation, the auto-offset-ranging feature of the circuit acts on the signal to
bring it within the high resolution range of the A/D (i.e., gain of 16) at all times. The introduced
offset is one of eight defined reference voltages covering the -750 mV to +1,350 mV range.
Armed with the three-bit code (B2, B1, B0) denoting the selectable value, the digitized SP can be
easily reconstructed on the surface to recover the true SP.
In a more detailed description, the noisy SP signal enters the circuit through an RC filter with an
over voltage protection network (bidirectional Zener diodes D3 and D4). Common mode
rejection and buffering is performed by U18, operating at unity gain. The signal is further filtered
by a two-pole, low-pass filter for an overall 6 Hz response.
Unity gain differential amplifier (U25) functioning as a summing node, in combination with a
digital/analog feedback network, provides an offset to the filtered SP signal. This works to keep

The resistor divider network across the reference voltages (±1,350 mV) establish the eight signed
references  in 300 mV increments. Analog mux U21 in concert with counter U22 select one of the
eight offsets. A second voltage divider derives the band limit references +50 mV and +550 mV
for the window comparator (U20). The comparator enables the counter to increment when the
signal exceeds 550 mV or decrement when it falls below 50 mV. The range of the SP signal in
which the feedback control action can function is ±1.3 volts.
Of particular importance is the magnitude of the coarse 300 mV increment, because it represents a
hysteresis large enough for operating with less frequent code switching. This minimizes any
discontinuities or spikes that could be introduced in the process. Hopefully, the circuit searches
initially only for the correct range at the 250 kHz clock rate of the counter and then settles. Note
that if the raw SP signal is close to zero, one of two possible offset codes (100 for 150 mV or 011
for 450 mV) may be generated, depending on whether the counts proceeds up or down on startup.
This is normal.
The control network works on the SP signal after the filtering stage for a faster response.
4.12 Channel 14 (chv)
Channel 14 measures the cablehead voltage for instrument power. A secondary winding on the
main power transformer T1 supplies about a 9 VRMS signal at a normal 180 VRMS input
voltage. U23 is a RMS to DC converter that requires only a few external components for
operation. Unfortunately, the device does not work above 145º C. A flask and heatsink solve the
temperature problem as long as operating time of the instrument is not exceeded. Components
values for DC averaging time constant (C40) and 2-pole post filter (C41, C42, and R78) yield a
1% total DC and ripple error.
The scaling pot P1 should be trimmed to 1.8 Vdc at channel output with 180 VRMS applied at
the cablehead (conductors 1 and 4). Use an AC voltmeter that measures true RMS to measure the
180 VRMS.
4.13 Channel 15 (AC Mtr Volts)
Channel 15 measures the motor voltage at the cablehead. More precisely, it measures between
conductors 10 and the phantom center tap of wireline mode 5. this voltage can be as high as 440
volts, AC or DC. A special transformer, T2, mounted on the backbone, supplies 9 VRMS to this
channel when its primary is powered with the rated 440 VRMS. A capacitor in series with T2
keeps the full DC voltage from being applied across T2.
For instruments requiring AC power between mode 5 center tap and pin 10, as is the case for RCI,
conductor 7 should first be disconnected by setting relay K1 to the AC MOTOR state. This
improves mode 2 and mode 5 communications. Mode 7 is not usable while motoring the RCI.
Channel 15 is similar to channel 14 except that the scaling factor used is 5 mVdc per 1 VRMS
instead of 10 mVdc per 1 VRMS. Therefore pot P2 must be adjusted for 2.2 Vdc at the channel

3590XA-TMTY-AMO,Circuit Description - 5.0 MUD RESISTIVITY BOARD,"MUD RESISTIVITY BOARD
Refer to assembly drawing A3001574000 and schematic A3001574 SCH during the circuit
discussions of the mud resistivity board.
The circuit utilizes an input square wave at 7812.5 Hz for a precision voltage reference. The
square wave is filtered by a two-stage, stagger-tuned band-pass filter (U1 A and U1 B) to generate
a low harmonic content sine wave to drive the constant current amplifier. A voltage of about 1.2 V
p-p is applied to the primary of transformer T1. T1 provides isolation from the current driver U2.
Transformer T1 has a 1:1 turns ratio such that the 1.2 V p-p is applied through the power amplifier
to resistor R12. In the configuration shown in the schematic, the circuit adjusts to maintain this
fixed voltage drop across R12 and in so doing provides a constant current to any load placed from
the junction of T1 and R12 to ground. R26 prevents the circuit from oscillating if E1 is directly
shorted to E4.
In Log mode, a constant current travels from the driver U2 through R26, K1, and out terminal E1.
Terminal E1 is connected to the upper mud sense electrode. Current then travels through the
MUD to the lower MUD Electrode, finally returning to terminal E4.
The voltage drop across the mud column between the upper and lower electrodes (via terminals
E2 and E3) is sensed by instrumentation amplifier U3. The high impedance inputs on the
amplifier prevent loading of the measure current in the fluid. Capacitors C5 and C6 block any DC
voltage generated in the borehole from amplifier U3.
The output from U3 is supplied to phase splitter stage U4 to drive the isolation transformer T2.
T2 has a 1:2 turns ratio. However, signals add up at the center tap input resulting in a voltage gain
of 1. U5 is a double pole FET switch IC that is driven by the input reference signal at 7812.5 Hz.
The alternate opening and closing of the switches provide a full wave, synchronous detection of
the received signal. This voltage is supplied to the A/D converter and is sent uphole as VRM.
Relay K1 switches the drive current from externally driving the borehole to a internal resistor
divider R13/R14. This in conjunction with relays K2 and K3 provide a method to inject a zero or
cal signal into the acquisition stream. Relay control M1 through M5 originates from the A/D

Filter
The bottom side of this board is a band-pass filter for the M2 receiver. The first two stages make
up a four-pole, high-pass filter that blocks 60 Hz RCI motor noise. The third stage is a low-pass

resistor R5 is the first element of a cascaded RC filter on the repeater board.
The filter circuit on the filter/driver board works with the filter and equalization circuits on the
repeater board to form a filter system. This system attenuates undesired frequencies and provides
a flat response for desired signal frequencies, while reducing signal baseline ringing to a
minimum. See the Manufacturing Checkout document (F131034856) included with this manual

3944XD-SWVL-AMO,Description of Service - ,"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE 
 
3944 XD 3-3/8"" SWIVEL ASSEMBLY 
 
 
131058-935  
MARCH 2006 
 
 
The 3944 XD Swivel Assembly allows different portions of the tool string to rotate independently.            
It allows unrestricted 360° rotation by means of an internal slip-ring assembly. 
 
A swivel isolates an instrument from the normal torque induced as the spiral-wound wireline is lowered 
into and pulled out of the well. This torque causes the tool string to rotate slowly — typically one or    
two rotations per 100 ft. (30 m) of depth for a seasoned line. Typically, this rotation does not cause any 
problems.  
 
However, excessive rotation may degrade some well log data, such as the data from Diplog-type tools.    
In addition, some instruments (notably the Density and Z-Density tools) feature a powerful motorized 
caliper arm that causes the tool to “seek” and hold orientation across the widest axis of the wellbore. 
Other tools have positioners to force this orientation or to hold another specific orientation. This forced 
orientation prevents wireline torque from rotating the string.  
 
The built-up torque can cause the tool to break loose suddenly and spin, resulting in an interval of reduced 
log quality. In severe cases, the built-up torque can actually damage the wireline by causing the armor 
wires to “unlay,” resulting in high strands or “birdcages.” The use of a swivel in these situations allows 
the upper portion of the string to rotate, relieving wireline torque, while the lower portion (below the 
swivel) is able to maintain the preferred orientation. 
 
The 3944 XD Swivel Assembly has a Dresser Atlas (DA) tool joint connection at each end. The swivel 
must therefore be located above the 3510 or 3514 WTS Telemetry instrument. The 3939 XA WTS Swivel 
has WTS connections, and is used below the telemetry instrument."
3944XD-SWVL-AMO,Mechanical Description - ,"MECHANICAL DESCRIPTION 
 
3944 XD 3-3/8"" SWIVEL ASSEMBLY 
 
 
 
131058-946 
MARCH 2006 
 
The complete 3944 XD 3-3/8"" Swivel Assembly consists of a one-piece 3-3/8"" housing with 
accompanying sub and a quick-change connector at each end. The shipping length of the entire             
unit is 4 ft. 11.2 in. (1.25 m), and it cannot be broken down into smaller sections for shipping. 
 
The cavity between the floating piston in the lower housing and the stop ring is filled with silicone         
oil. This equalizes internal and external pressures that act on the Swivel Assembly, thus preventing        
the failure of its housing under downhole conditions. At high temperatures the expanding oil pushes    
down the compensator, thus establishing pressure equilibrium. In high downhole pressures, external 
pressure pushes the piston in, thus increasing internal oil pressure; equilibrium is again achieved. 
 
Refer to the Brief Description of Service (Section -935 in this manual) for additional details."

1.
Fill the vacuum pump (P/N F078810000) with silicone oil (P/N F203208000).
2.
Hang the swivel assembly upside down in an approximately vertical position.
This will facilitate the oil filling process.
3.
Connect the suction line fitting on the vacuum pump to the top adapter sub port [9].
4.
Connect the oil return line on the vacuum pump to the lower housing port [56].
5.
Close the valve on the oil return line and open the valve on the suction line. Turn
on the vacuum pump to draw a vacuum on the swivel assembly.
6.
When the vacuum reaches 30 inches Hg, close the valve on the suction line.
7.
Turn off the vacuum pump.
8.
Watch the vacuum gauge for about 10 minutes for a quick check of leaks in the
system. If the system leaks, the vacuum will drop.
9.
Open the circulating valve on the vacuum pump to allow oil to flow into the swivel
assembly.
10.
Open the valve on the suction line and turn on the vacuum pump to let oil
circulate. It will take approximately 30 minutes to 11/2 hours before the system
is well vacuumed. Once the system is well vacuumed no air bubbles should be
in the suction line coming from the swivel assembly.
11.
Lay the swivel assembly down and close all valves on the vacuum pump.
12.
Remove the return line hose from the lower housing. Install the plug [12].
13.
Turn on the pump and pressurize the swivel assembly until the floating piston [58]
is fully extended. Relieve the pressure to allow the piston to move approximately 2”.
14.
Remove the hose from the top adapter sub and quickly install the plug.
15.
Hold the depth-setting gauge [62] against the uphole side of the opening in the lower
housing. Loosen the plug [12] to bleed excess oil, until the floating piston [58] is
positioned at 2.50 inches against the end of the gauge. See DWG. P/N 197027-000."
3944XD-SWVL-AMO,Assembly/Disassembly - 15.2 CHECKING FOR OIL LEAKS,"27

1.
Place the swivel assembly in an oven.
2.
Heat the oven to 200°F and keep the oven at this temperature for approximately
30 minutes.
3.
Thoroughly check for oil leaks. If oil leaks do exist, fix the leaks and repeat
the oil-filling procedures described in Section 14.1 above."
3944XD-SWVL-AMO,Assembly/Disassembly - 15.3 DRAINING THE OIL,"28

WARNING
The swivel assembly is filled with silicone oil, which expands with increased
temperatures, such as those that might be encountered during downhole
operations or heat testing. THE RESULTING INCREASE IN OIL PRESSURE
IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. Do not attempt to drain the oil until the swivel
assembly has cooled down.
1.
Place the swivel assembly on tool stands using the upper cable sub and the bottom quick-
change sub to support the swivel assembly.
2.
Using an Allen wrench, remove the two plugs [12] — one each in the top adapter sub and in
the lower housing.
3.
Turn the swivel assembly so that the oil-filling hole in the lower housing is facing the floor.
4.
Lift at the top end of the swivel assembly to help the oil drain.
CAUTION
If the color of the silicone oil is whitish, well fluids (water) have penetrated
the system. If this has happened, completely clean the inside of the swivel
assembly before reassembly."

3980XA-TTMA-AMO,Training Supplement - 1.0 SERVICE OVERVIEW,"SERVICE OVERVIEW

The series 3980 XA TTMA is a 3-1/8” O.D. self-contained Matrix compatible instrument
containing transducers for measurement of cablehead Tension/compression borehole
Temperature, Mud resistivity and 3-axis Acceleration as explained below.  The acquired
information is sent via the Telemetry instrument to the surface.

The instrument operates with its own unique address for running in a Matrix tool string.
Communications with the instrument is via the Matrix telemetry protocol. Matrix
communication is patterned after the WTS protocol and this instrument operates on
Mode 2 for commands and data, but also has provision for transmitting data via Mode 5
and Mode 7.  Matrix surface equipment includes a DC power supply, Line Control panel,
Real-time Acquisition panel, a PC (personal computer) with data storage facilities, and
necessary software for running the service.

Tension:
A load cell, located near the top of the TTMA and O-ring sealed from the borehole
environment, is used to measure longitudinal stresses.  The load cell is geometrically
compensated for borehole pressure changes and does NOT require balancing using the
traditional silicon oil and rubber boot.  Its measurement range is from –12,000 lbs
(compression) to +12,000 lbs (tension).

Temperature:
The temperature sensor is a Platinum element RTD probe protruding from a side pocket
machined into the TTMA body.  Its measurement range is 0º to 150º C.

Mud Resistivity:
A recessed, 2-electrode, cylindrical array is used to collect Mud Resistivity information.
The geometry of the design provides a measurement with an extremely shallow depth of
investigation.  That parameters measured are the voltage across, and the current
between, the two electrodes.  The Mud Resistivity measurement range is 0.02 to 3 ohm-
m.

Accelerometers:
Three accelerometers mounted orthogonally measure acceleration in the X, Y and Z axis
of the tool body.  These measurements provide the raw data to compute borehole
inclination, tool face (high side), and a depth correction for “stick and pull.”  The
measurement range is +3 to –3 g.

Note: The 3980 is typically run above the Telemetry to get the best results from
the cablehead tension measurement.  However, it can be run anywhere in the
string should it be required.

Mode 2 Receive Command / Data: Mode 2 commands / data are sent
from the surface and transformer-coupled via T2 on the CPU board.  U2
converts line signals to TTL levels.  The equivalent of a 6408 Harris
Manchester Encoder / Decoder has been incorporated into Actel (U5).
U5 decodes this Manchester protocol data (MD2 UDI) and converts the
serial data to parallel data.  U5 checks the received data for a universal
address 00 or TTMA tool address.  If either address is received, interrupt
M2 RXIRQ (INT1) is sent to the CPU (U8) and the command is transferred
to a buffer.  M2 RXIRQ is reset by the CPU after the command is read by
130870-945 / 3980 XA

3980 XA TTMA – Circuit Description
the CPU.  If data follows the WTS command, interrupt M2 RXIRQ (INT1)
is sent to the CPU (U8) and the data is transferred to a buffer.  M2 RXIRQ
is reset by the CPU after each data word is read.

Mode 2 Transmit Data: On receipt of a command from the surface to
transmit data via Mode 2 (such as tool tables or tool status), the CPU
enables interrupt INT2 (M2 TXIRQ) and sends the requested data via the
16 bit data bus to U5, Mode 2 encoder logic.  U5 converts the data from
parallel to serial format and the U5 6408 Harris Manchester equivalent
encoder, encodes MD2 BZO data and MD2 BOO data.  Data is then sent
to line driver (U1).  Data is then transformer coupled to the WTS buss via
T1.  Whenever the U5 data buffer is empty, U5 generates an interrupt
(M2 TXIRQ); and the CPU sends the next word.

Mode 5 / Mode 7 DMA Control: The equivalent of a 6409 Harris
Manchester has been incorporated into Actel (U5) for Mode 5/7 data
transmission.  Mode 5/7 data is transmitted using DMA channel 0
(DRQ0).  SMD5 DRQ (see
) selects which mode will be used
for the transmitter Mode 5 or Mode 7.
surface to transmit Mode 5/7 data the CPU enables DMA channel 0 and
writes the requested data via the 16 bit data bus to U5, Mode 5/7 encoder
logic.  The data is converted from parallel to serial format by U5.  Serial
data is received by the U5, a 6409 Harris Manchester equivalent encoder
and the encoded data (BZO5 and BOO5) is sent to line driver U3 or
BZO7 and BOO7 is sent to line driver U4.  Mode 5/Mode 7 data is then
transformer coupled to the WTS buss via T3 and T4 respectively.
Whenever the data buffer is empty, MD57 DRQ is active; and the CPU
writes the next data word via the 16 bit data bus to U5.

Transmission of data is currently used only when sending Subset E.

3980 XA TTMA – Circuit Description
1.5.3 SYNCHRONOUS SERIAL TRANSMIT / RECEIVE LOGIC
The clock speed is set by firmware and currently 1 MHz is used
throughout.  Each of these serial links has a transmit-frame sink
(bgateout/TFS_x) for beginning and ending a transmission, and a data
transmit (bdataout/DT_x) line for transmission of data (i.e. tables,
commands, etc.).  Each of these serial links also has a receive-frame sink
(bgatein/RFS_x) and a data receive (bdatain/DR_x) line for receiving
data.

The CPU writes commands and data to U5’s two 8 bit latch’s via the data
bus.  Data is converted to the serial format using the 1 MHz SCLK and two
8 bit shift registers.  Bgateout\ is active low, and bdataout is the serial
data signal.  Data is shifted out on the positive edge of BSCLK.
STXDRQ (DRQ3) becomes active whenever the output latch is empty.

on the positive edge of BSCLK when BGATIN frame signal is active
(high).  The Actel (U5) inverts the data before it is shifted into the shift
registers.  A 16 bit counter and flip flop are used to latch the data into two
8-bit latches.  The flip-flop is also used to indicate to the CPU that data
has been received (S1 RXDRQ).  The flip-flop is reset when the CPU
reads the data.  The S1 RXDRQ signal is connected to the CPU DRQ1

1.5.4 LATCHED ADDRESS BUS

Two eight bit latches and three single bit latches, latch address MA0 to
MA18 when ALE signal is high.
1.5.5 CONTROL OF ANALOG POWER SUPPLIES

When operating in battery mode, control over the power supplies
becomes essential to prolonging battery life.  Control signals emanating
from the FPGA (U5) cntrl2 and cntrl3 control the ON/OFF time of the
±12 V and ±5 V power supplies respectively.  Normally both of these bits
are 0 to keep theses supplies turned ON.  Bits change to a 1 when it is
necessary to turn them OFF.
Control signal cntrl2 ties to the base of transistor Q2.  Since it is normally
low, it does nothing to the transistor and the collector is allowed to float at
the level of the opto-isolator voltage that controls the INHIBIT pin1 of the
power supply.  When it is necessary to turn OFF the supply, the control
signal goes high, turning the transistor ON and driving the INHIBIT pin
low.
In similar fashion, control signal cntrl3 controls transistor Q3.
1.5.6 MISCELLANEOUS LOGIC

See the following block diagram for the miscellaneous logic contained
within U5.


1 INHIBIT pin is tied to this circuitry through an opto-isolator circuit associated with the EMI Filter
board.  See the full discussion of this isolator circuit shown in

5. Current and Voltage sensing across two conductive rings to measure the MUD
Resistivity.
The circuit of the board divided in two parts.  Sensors 1, 2, 3 and 4 are found on
page 1 of the schematic of 199666-100.  Sensor 5 is found on page 2 of the
Accelerometer:
Accelerometer outputs are X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z- and are differential in nature.
These signals are inputs for the circuitry and are filtered at cut off frequency
0.2 Hz (U5, U6, U7 and U8).  Also, the Z input is filtered at 8 HZ which is called
FZ (Fast Z).  X, Y, Z and FZ are converted into digital signals every 40 ms by
U13 (a Multiplexed 16 Bit A/D).  Maximum amplitude of the input is an expected
+/- 5 V signal, but the actual A/D input range is +/- 10 V.
ATEMP is the voltage output of the accelerometer’s temperature sensor (AD592
in the accelerometer module).  The signal is buffered by U14 and filtered by R35
and C148 before entering U15, a 12 bit A/D.  It is sampled every 40 milliseconds.

Mud Temperature:
A constant current of 400 microamperes, from U11, is generated and flows
through R10, the RTD sensor and R69 (1 K).  This constant current across R10
(5.1 K) provides a voltage reference of +2.04 Vdc for the A/D converter. Voltage
across the Platinum RTD sensor (Temp+ and Temp– inputs) is converted to 24
bits (channel 1 of U11) every 100 milliseconds.  In CAL mode, it reads a 40 mV
signal across resistor R69 on channel 2 of U11.

Tension:
+5 VT and -5 VT provides a constant voltage across the bridge circuit of the strain
gauge.  Strain Gauge output signals, T+ and T–, are filtered using capacitors
C162, C163 and C164 and interfaced using Instrument Amplifier U1.  R1 makes
gain of 100 for U1.  R91 and C143 is also a filter before the A/D.  This signal is
converted to 24 bits (channel 1 of U12) every 100 milliseconds.  In CAL mode,
the input switched to channel 2 and reads a 2 volt signal across R93.

FPGA:
FPGA, U17 has the following logic functions.
1. Synchronous Communication: Convert Data Serial to Parallel (datain/,
gatein, sclk/) and Parallel to Serial output of data (dataout, gateout/).
2. Interpretation of the Commands:

4. Read Tension 24 bit A/D data whenever DRDY1/ is active (low level).  It shifts

5. Generate signals (tfs0/, tfs1/, AD0, AD1) to write data into A/D
6. To read Accelerometer Temperature data by shifting serial data to 16 bit
Parallel (atcs, atsdata, atsclk).  Actual A/D data output is 12 bit.
7. To generate a 1 ms timer signal from 5 MHz clock.  Use 1 ms tick to increment
Atimer of 32 bits.  At every 40 ms, it reads X, Y, Z and FZ sequentially from U13
and Atemp from U15.  Also, it transfers Mud temperature and Tension data from
the input buffer to the transmit buffer.  Generate ZRDY interrupt to the CPU.
Whenever the send command is received, it sends data to the controller.
8. To select the channel to read X, Y, Z or FZ (ch0, ch1, wr1/, wr2/).  To send
r_c/ pulse to sample the data, and read-and-convert serial to parallel when busy
is not active.
9. Whenever U17 receives DRDY0/ and DRDY1/ from U11 and U12, it reads and
stores data in 24 bit buffers.
10. It also drives LED DS1 to indicate the proper function of the logic.

Resistivity:
The Mud Resistance measurement circuitry is divided into the following sections.
1. To generate a 7.8125 KHz sine wave signal
2. To measure the current and voltage across the two electrodes
3. To control relay for LOG/ZERO/CAL operation
4. To interface with the controller
5. To select gain for the voltage measurement
This section of the circuit is isolated from the rest of the electronics using opto
isolator for the communication and floating power supply using separate +/-5 V
Power supply.
U36, U37 and U41 are making the isolation between mud driver ground and
Controller ground.

3980 XA TTMA – Circuit Description
Controller:
2181 DSP processor (U34) runs at 32 MHz with a clock input of 16 MHz (U32).
On power up, U33 generates PRESET signal low for 200 ms and then the DSP
loads its operating program from the Flash memory (U42).  JMP4 decides which
program is to be loaded into the DSP.  Without JMP4, it loads the Application
Program. With JMP4 installed, a boot program is loaded.  The boot program
allows updating of the Application Program contained in the lower 64 Kbytes of
U42.
On power up, the DSP configures U31 for a 7.8125 KHz frequency.  Clkin to U31
is 4 MHz.  The output seen at terminal E12 is 2 Vp-p.  U22 and U23 are used as
filter and buffer.  Output from U23 is an input of U31 to generate a ZREF signal.
This signal is used in U30 to synchronize sampling of the data.  U21 is the driver
power operational amplifier (opamp) to drive the constant voltage signal.  R27 is
the current limiting resistor and is set for 2 Amps.
Current Sensing Resistor is R21 (3 Ohm).  Voltage across this is input to U24
which has a gain of 2.  This signal is then passed through buffer U43 and
converted to a digital signal by U28, a 16 bit A/D.  Voltage across the mud rings
is input to the U27 which has gain of 2.  The signal is passed through a buffer
U44 and converted to digital by U29, a 16 bit A/D.  Both U28 and U29 are
sampled at the same time every 8 microseconds and data read sequentially and
Transferred to DSP on serial port 1.  Interrupt IRQ2 is generated every 8
microseconds.
To select LOG, U34-I/O port bit PF4 is set high for 20 ms.  This generates a
positive pulse at LOGCAL (U39) and switches relays K1 and K2.  This, in turn,
connects drive signals to the driver and return signals sens+, sens– to vs+, vs–,
respectively.
To select CAL, U34-I/O port bit PF5 and PF6 are set high for 20 ms.  These
generate a negative (–5v) signal at LOGCAL (U39) and a positive pulse at
HIGHLOW (U40).  These signals switch K1 and K2 to into the 10 ohm position,
and K3 to vs+, vs– across resistor R19.
To select ZERO, U34-I/O port bit PF5 and PF7 are set high for 20ms.  These
generate negative pulses at LOGCAL and HIGHLOW.  This causes the switching
of K1 and K2 to 0.25 ohm, K3 to vs+, vs– across resistor R20.
Gain for the Voltage input is always 2 (U34 output port FL2 is set to 1).

3980 XA TTMA – Circuit Description
APPENDIX A: DC POWER SUPPLIES
The 3980 XA TTMA has three power supplies mounted on the electronics
backbone.  Along with one of the supplies is an EMI filter module to drastically
reduce interference and interaction between supplies of other Matrix instruments.
These self-contained, modular supplies mount on a heat-sinking channel and
have additional circuitry mounted on a PC board that is soldered directly to the
pins of the supply.  It is this additional circuitry that will be the topic of discussion
for this section.
Because the power supplies are modular, there is no repair of the unit.  It either
works or it doesn’t.  The only circuitry external to the module (U1) is some
inhibiting control and some additional output filtering.
A ±5 volt supply mounts with an EMI filter module to make up the main supply.
Circuitry on the EMI filter PC board controls the ON/OFF function of the other two
supplies, another ±5 volt supply and a ±12 volt supply.  See the generic
descriptions of the associated circuitry below for common details.

Dual Power Supply
All three of the power supply modules are dual polarity.  That is, they have a plus
and a minus voltage output with respect to a common return.  See the schematic
below for a typical configuration of these external components for a dual output
power module.


130870-945 / 3980 XA
OCT 2003

3980 XA TTMA – Circuit Description
Instrument power first passes through an EMI filter module before being applied
to any DC to DC converter module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered
+28 V.  E2 is tied to the return line of the EMI filter output.  Pins 6, 7 and 8 are tied
to chassis ground, which is tied to cable armor.  Three independent windings of a
choke, L1, filter voltage spikes on the output of the module.  No provision is
made for trimming the output voltage.  Additional output filtering is provided by
capacitors C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7.

Power Control Circuit
Associated with at least one of the DC to DC power supply modules is an EMI
filter module.  The PC board attached to this module performs several control
functions.  These control functions are described below.
A simple +5 volt supply is generated for other chips on the PC board.  The supply
consists of a single dropping resistor (R3) and reference Zener diode (D1) to
establish the voltage.  This supply is connected to the output (pin 2) of the EMI
filter module (U1).  See the schematic below.


Refer to schematic diagram of the Power Supply Control circuit on page 17.  The
heart of the power control circuitry is a programmable microcontroller (U3).
Values for resistor R7 and capacitor C3 have been selected to give an operating
frequency of approximately 1 MHz.  Supplied with +5 volts from the supply of
, the microcontroller acts as a timer to control the turn-on time of
anything tied to its output.  There are basically three functions concerning this
circuit.  They are (1) a voltage threshold, (2) the delay circuit and (3) the
control/inhibit circuit.
(1) A threshold voltage is established using chip U4.  The voltage divider
consisting of R6 and R8 are chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for
instrument power) is present on R6, the reset chip removes the LOW on pin
7 which in turn removes the reset from the microcontroller, U3, allowing it to
do its job.

3980 XA TTMA – Circuit Description

(2) Jumper inputs to the microcontroller chip, U3, set different length delay
times.  Different turn-on times are established for tools to limit the current
demand when the Matrix tool sting is first powered up.  Delay times, in
milliseconds, and their jumpers are shown in the table below.

(3) When power is first applied to the microcontroller, output RA1 of U3 pin 18
is floating (open collector circuit).  Resistor R4 pulls the base of Q1 HIGH
turning it ON.  This state applies a ground potential to all power supplies tied to
the Q1 collector.  Diodes (D2 – D4) form an OR function in the collector circuit,
allowing control over different power supplies.  By tying the INHIBIT pin (active
low) of each DC-to-DC converter module within an instrument to one of these
control terminals (E5, E6 or E7), you can independently control its ON/OFF
function.  With Q1 initially turned ON, no power supply module can turn ON.  It
is not until the time-out function is completed by U3 that output RA1 can
transition LOW, turning OFF Q1.  With Q1 turned OFF, power supplies are
allowed to turn ON because their INHIBIT is removed.  As the power supplies
turn ON, their current demand is confined to that particular instrument.  Again,
see the control circuit on page 17.

Refer to drawing 198389-100 for the complete schematic of the Power
Controller board.  As an added feature of this circuit, Power Supply #2 or
Power Supply #3 can be turned OFF by an external source via opto-isolator
U2.  Terminal E8 is tied to a positive voltage.  Taking control terminal E9 or
E10 LOW causes its respective switch to close.  This applies a ground potential
to the INHIBIT input of the supply that is tied to its control terminal, E6 or E7.
This LOW turns OFF the respective power supply.  Terminal E9 controls a
power supply (P.S.2) connected to terminal E6, while E10 controls a supply
(P.S.3) connected to terminal E7.  Thus, independent control is available if
needed.  This feature is utilized in the TTMA to control two supplies – 199671-
000, the other ±5 V supply and 199672-000, the ±12 V supply – when in battery
mode.  Power supplies connected to E5 are solely controlled by the timing
function associated with the operation of transistor Q1 at initial power-up.  See

3981XA-TTRM-AMO,BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION
The 3981 XA TTRm is a 3-5/8"" diameter sub containing three types of transducers for
measurement of cablehead tension/compression force, borehole temperature, and mud
resistivity.
The sub is optional and does not contain any electronics. It is supported by the 3510 XA
WTS Common Remote, which contains the electronics portion of the 3981 XA.
The block diagram of the 3981 XA, Figure 935-1, shows a reference diagram of the pertinent
circuits in the 3510 XA. See the circuit descriptions (130220-945) in the 3510 XA manual and
the circuit descriptions (section -945) in this manual.

3981 XA TTRm SENSOR SUB FUNCTIONS
The functions of the 3981 XA are to detect and measure borehole temperature, mud resistivity
(Rm), and external cablehead tension and compression forces at the top of the tool string and
send this information to the aquisition unit via the 3510 Common Remote.
The Strain Gauge Load Cell of the Force Gauge portion of the 3981 XA has the capability to
measure from -10,000 lbs (compression) to +14,000 lbs (tension). The electronic circuit in
the 3510 XA, which processes the Strain Gauge signal, can accomodate a range of +/-12,000
lbf.
The Temperature Sensor is an RTD probe with a range of -55°C to 245°C.
The Mud Resistivity Sensor is a cylindrical electrode array with geometry designed for
extremely shallow depth of investigation and a measurement range of 0.01 Ohm-M to 10.0
Ohm-M. The corresponding output signal varies from 4.8 mv to 4.8 volts.

NOTE
The 3981 XA must be run above the 3510 WTS Common Remote
Instrument.
A Remote Meter and cabling are available as optional equipment with the 3981 XA TTRm
Sensor Sub for use with pipe conveyed logging and coiled tubing conveyed logging
operations. See CHT Remote Meter operating instructions in CLS Operations Volume 5 for
further details.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE - 3981 XA TTRm SENSOR SUB"
3981XA-TTRM-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 1.0 FORCE GAUGE,"FORCE GAUGE
Refer to figure 945-1.
The strain gauge load cell in the 3981 XA is comprised of four active strain gauge arms
bonded to a tensile member in a balanced Wheatstone Bridge configuration. Each sensing
arm combines two 350 ohm foil elements, in series, to yield the specified 700 ohm bridge.
Bridge excitation is supplied by the 3510 XA electronics as an active 10 VDC source. The
bridge node is sensed by another feedback line referenced to a precision voltage to maintain
an accurate 10 V supply.
The sensitivity of the bridge is about 0.1 mV/V/1000 lbf or, 1 mV/1000 lbf with the 10 V
excitation. The small signal is handled by a high gain instrumentation amplifier to reject any
common mode noise and cover the required ±12000 lbf range."
3981XA-TTRM-AMO,CIRCUIT DESCRIPTIONS - 2.0 BOREHOLE TEMPERATURE,"BOREHOLE TEMPERATURE
A platinum Resistance Temperature Device was selected as the sensing element for borehole
temperature measurement. The RTD is wire wound inside a custom-made 1"" long metal
probe. The resistance of the RTD element is specified as 500 ohm at 0°C. The platinum
wire has a standard change in resistance of Alpha = 0.00385 ohm/ohm/°C. The temperature
of the probe is measured as a function of the change in its resistance. A constant current
source supplied by the 3510 XA electronics develops the corresponding measured voltage
across the RTD. The 1 mA current is small enough to minimize self-induced heating of the
probe to a negligible value.

MUD RESISTIVITY (Rm)
Some services require knowledge of the mud resistivity for computed logs. A miniature array
of cylindrical electrodes mounted around the lower third section of the Sensor Sub provides
this capability.
The electrodes are spaced 0.125"" apart. Using the lateral principle from the electrolog, Rm is
measured across electrodes #2 and #3. Return electrodes #4 are only 0.625"" away from
center electrode #1 to limit the depth of investigation to the surrounding mud column.
The K factor for the electrode geometry in the 1 ohm-m homogeneous case is calculated to be
1.6522 ohm-m/ohm. The Zero and Cal values of the resistor arrangement in the 3510 Rm
circuit was based on this factor.

DESCRIPTION 
3996 NA 6.75"" O.D. Electra-Magnet 

inches 
(171 mm) and a length of 17.2 inches (437 mm). It consists 
of a top sub which contains 
a 10 pin female connector, 
a cross 
over sub, an electro-magnet 
body, a spring operated 
outer sleeve, 
and a magnet coil over a core. The maximum 
lifting force of the 
magnet is 1,680 pounds which is based on 100% contact with a 2.0 
in. thick mild steel slab. The lifting power will decrease 
according 
to the amount of contact established 
with the fish. 
The outer sleeve is a protection 
device to keep the fish from 
being scrapped 
off by the borehole 
or casing wall. 
Use of the 
outer sleeve is optional. 
It can be removed or installed 
following 
assembly/disassembly 
procedures

Fishing Tool 
The 3336 Electra-Magnet 
Fishing Tool can be run in combination 
with some logging tools, primarily 
those requiring 
DC power on a 
single conductor. 
Because the magnet requires 
only 55 volts AC, 
it cannot be run with instruments 
that derive power from 
conductors 
4 & 6. 
When used in casing, 
it is especially 
desirable 
to run the 
instrument 
with a casing collar locator for precise location 
of 
the fish. 
The 2317/2330 
series CCL's have thru-wire 
capability 
for powering 
the Electra-Magnet 
Fishing Tool and require no power 
for the CCL. 
The 2323 CCL can be used if powered with DC 
voltage. 
A DC powered 
1309 Gamma Ray can also be run above the 
fishing tool for depth correlation 
in both cased and open holes.

The amount of surface voltage to be applied to achieve a 
predetermined 
cablehead 
voltage will depend on the cable 
type and length. 
This should be measured 
and noted before 
going in the hole. 
Cablehead 
voltage should be limited to a 
maximum 
of 55 VAC ( approximately 
1.9 amps ) under all 
conditions. 
Multi-conductor 
cables of 20,000 ft. (6100 m.) 
will allow a maximum cablehead 
voltage of approximately 
42 
volts at approximately 
1.4 amps when powered by a 2061 power 
supply. 
After maximum 
cablehead 
voltage has been determined, 
use 
Figure 1 to determine 
the maximum relative 
lifting force 
available. 
Should the cablehead 
voltage on long cables be 
inadaquate 
to achieve the needed lifting force, conductors 
3 
and 5 can be connected 
in parallel 
with conductors 
4 and 6, 
both at the surface and downhole, 
to reduce cable 
resistance. 
Power should not be applied while running in the hole. 
This 
will keep the magnet from collecting 
metal debris that could 
prevent 
it from making contact with the fish. 
Maximum 
cablehead 
voltage 
as determined 
in step 1 should be 
used when contacting 
the fish or on entering 
the casing when 
coming out of the hole. 
Otherwise, 
cablehead 
voltage 
can be 
reduced to 35 volts 
(approximately 
1 amp.) while coming out 
of the hole to keep the magnet from heating up. 
Hoisting 
speed should be consistent 
with the type of fish. 
Large or heavy objects should be run at slower speeds to 
keep the fish from being scrapped of by the borehole 
or 
casing wall.

CHECKOUT PROCEDURES
3996 NA 6.75"" O.D. Electro-Magnet Fishing Tool
1.
Electrical Insulation and Continuity Checks ( Meter )
Check the instrument for electrical continuity and leakage using an ohm
meter capable of reading 20 meg ohms or greater.  Electrical insulation
should exceed 20 meg ohms from pins 4 and 6 to pressure housing.
Electrical continuity between pins 4 and 6 should be checked using the
diode scale of a digital meter or a low (100 ohm) scale of an analog
meter.  Reversing meter polarity between pins 4 and 6 should result in
uniform readings within +/- 10 percent.  The continuity check can only
detect an open in the coil or diode leg.  It will not detect a shorted
winding in the coil.
2.
Electrical Continuity Check ( Voltage vs. Current )
Because the resistance of the magnet coil is low (approximately 24
ohms), and because the diodes are in series with the coil, it is not
possible to accurately check the coil for shorted windings using an ohm
meter.
To check for proper continuity, connect pins 4 and 6 of the electro-
magnet tool directly to a 2061 Power Supply.  Apply 1 amp. of current to
the magnet.  The voltage between pins 4 and 6 should measure 36 volts AC
+/- 10 percent."

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE - 4401 WTS ORIENTATION TOOL
P/N  130641-935
SEPTEMBER 1998
The 4401 XB Orientation Sub is a general purpose borehole orientation instrument.  It continuously
establishes the position of the toolstring with respect to vertical and magnetic north.
It provides digital acquisition of three orthogonal accelerometers, three orthogonal magnetometers, and
temperature which comprises the sensor package.  Additionally, several in-circuit quality control points are
monitored and reflected by the instrument status information command.  The instrument returns data to the
surface using the standard WTS communication protocol and operates only
on mode 2."

3.0  CPU BOARD
(Reference Drawing C153910-000)
The CPU board contains two independent sections.
The Analog section is electrically isolated from the digital section and it is made up of IC-7 and IC-8.  The
multiplexer (IC-7) is paralleled with the mux on the A/D board. This multiplexer is used to select signals
from the flask temperature and power supplies.  The Analog section also contains a 10 volt precision
voltage source (IC-8).  The voltage source is divided by R7 to a precise 4799 mV and transferred to the
main analog board to be used as a scale reference.
The digital section of the CPU board performs as follows:
IC-2 is the main oscillator supplying a 12 mHz clock to the CPU.  IC-3 is a power-on reset
circuit that releases the CPU for operation when the 5 v supply exceeds 4.5 volts.  IC-4 is a
serial EEROM that stores the tool asset number. This EEROM is wired for serial address 2
and is parallel via SCL and SDA with an identical part (address 0) embedded within the
sensor module.
IC-1 is a Intel 87 C51 Micro Controller incorporating RAM, EPROM, and I/O into a single 40 pin DIP.  I/O
is divided between the 4 ports on the micro-controller are as follows:
Port 0 emulates a bi-directional 8 bit data bus. IC-5 provides pull-up resistors for the open drain outputs of
port 0.  The data bus leaves the CPU board via a 16 conductor cable plugged into connector H1.  The data
bus goes directly to the telemetry board and nowhere else. Read Write control originates from port 2 and
also leaves the CPU board to the telemetry board via H1.
Port 1
1.
Supplies the A/D and sample/hold control signals, hold, start, and serial data bit.
2.
Supplies the clock for the serial EEROM (SCL) and the bi-directional data bit (SDA).
3.
Also senses communication sync type (command/data) from the telemetry board.
Port 2
supplies the 4 bit address used to control the 16 channel multiplexer.  These signals leave the CPU
board and are routed to the analog board via 16 conductor cable at H2.
Port 3
1.
Supplies a watchdog reset bit to IC-3 (WDI).
2.
Senses when the send buffer on the telemetry board is full.
3.
Senses and generates a system interrupt when a valid word is received by the telemetry
board."

(Reference Drawing B153909-100)
The telemetry board contains a bus driver IC-1, T1  and bus receiver IC-2, T2.  Manchester IC-4 encodes
and decodes the serial data as it enters and leaves the board.  IC-12 is the 4 MHZ telemetry oscillator.  IC-
13 divides the oscillator to the correct manchester frequencies.  IC-3 is a latch that is set to start the encoder
for a send transaction.  Two sections of IC-5 buffer the receive sync type.  IC-8 and IC-11 form the send
buffer.  IC-6, IC-9, IC-7, and IC10 form the double buffer receive section."

4.1  SEND TRANSACTIONS
To send a word from the micro controller onto the instrument bus the following transactions will occur.
The MSB of the word being sent will be put onto the data bus. Write MSB (WMSB) will pulse low (2 micro
sec) to latch the data into IC-8. The LSB of the word to send will be put on the data bus.  Write LSB
(WLSB) will be pulsed low (2 micro sec) to latch the data into IC-11. WLSB also sets latch Q of IC-3 and
resets Q/ of IC-3.  Q/ of IC-3 immediately sets send busy (SB) IC-15 pin 8 indicating to the controller that
telemetry is now busy sending data.  Q of IC-3 sets encoder enable (EE) of the manchester which initiates a
send sequence. The manchester begins sending sync to IC-1 and to the instrument bus.  When the
manchester is ready to send the 16 bits of data previously stored in shift registers IC-8 and IC-11 SD of IC-4
goes high.  SD going high does 4 things.
1.
IC-15 is held busy independently of IC-3.
2.
IC-3 clocks a low onto the Q output releasing EE.  Q/ of IC-3 releases pre-busy on pin 10 of IC-15.
SB remains in the busy state via IC15 pin 9.
3.
SD at pin 1 of IC-14 allows the encoder shift clock (ESC) to pass to the clock inputs of shift
registers IC-8 and IC-11.  SD is connected to DR (Decoder Root).
4.
SD going high resets the manchester decoder effectively locking out all received signals.  When the
16 data bits have been shifted out SD goes low releasing send busy (SB) completing the send
sequence."

The outputs of accelerometers Ax, Ay, Az and magnetometers Mx, MY, Mz found in orientation module
C119500-000 pass through the six channel filters before entering the 8-channel analog multiplexer.  Filters
designated IC-1 through IC-6 are identical and have a cut-off frequency of .2 Hz.  Each of the six filters has
a gain of 1 and is non-inverting.
Outputs from the orientation module depend on the earth's gravitational pull and magnetic field present at
the module.  The module is scaled 3 volts/g for the accelerometers and 8 volts/gauss for the magnetometers.

(Reference Drawing 153908-100)
Multiplexer IC-7 is used to select one of the six orientation vectors ground or scale reference.  Mux channel
selection (channel 0-7) originates at the CPU and enters the analog board via a 16 conductor ribbon cable at
J1.  The Mux output is paralleled with an identical Mux on the CPU board and connected via the MX2
terminal.
The output of the mux is fed into the sample-hold circuit at IC-8.  The output of the sample-hold is supplied
directly to the A/D IC-9 pin 11.  All timing originates at the CPU.
NOTE
The A/D clock only operates during an acquisition cycle and is OFF
otherwise.
Data acquisition follows this sequence.
1.
The A/D clock is started (20 microsec clock).
2.
Mux channel is set into IC-7 via MUX0 - MUX3.
3.
Samp/Hold IC-8 put into SAMPLE mode.
4.
After 20 microsec samp/hold is set to HOLD mode.
5.
A/D START.
6.
12 data bits are clocked out ADAT to the CPU.
7.
A/D clock stopped.
There is NO offset or scale adjustment.  When operating under WTS protocol requesting SUBSET data
causes the CPU to sample Mux channel 0 (ground) and Mux channel 7 (REF).  The ground offset is
subtracted from each of the sampled channels.  No additional offset correction is required.  The REF
standard (4799 mV) is sent uphole as an entry in the subset table and is applied via the surface software to
make any necessary scale corrections."

SEPTEMBER 1998
When the 4401 is receiving a word on the instrument bus the following transactions occur.  As the word is
received on the instrument bus it is transferred through T2 and IC-2 to the UDI input of IC-4.  The sync type
of the received word is determined and reflected onto the CDS pin of IC-4.  At this point IC-4 is ready to
shift out serial data on the SDO pin and indicates this by raising take data (TD).  TD allows the DSC
through IC-14 to clock the serial data stream into shift registers IC-9 and IC-6.  The DSC is also clocking
CDS into IC-5 effectively delaying CDS by one DSC clock cycle.  When 16 bits have been shifted in TD
goes low.  TD going low latches the last value of CDS into IC-5 pin 5.  TD also transfers the contents of
shift registers IC-6 and IC-9 into tri-state latches IC-7 and IC-10.  The received word is now complete, the
manchester IC-4 checks the parity bit on the word just received, and if correct, it signals valid word (VW)
on pin 1.  VW is inverted, and then leaves the telemetry board via J1 to the CPU.  VW causes an interrupt
at the CPU.  The word just received is read a byte at a time from IC-7 and IC-10 by the CPU strobing
RMSB and RLSB.
NOTE
If the CPU is busy it can take up to 500 microseconds between VW
interrupt and when the CPU actually reads the 2 bytes."

INTRODUCTION

The following maintenance procedure is intended to give the technician some insight into the operation of the
4401. It is not a step-by-step procedure. However, it is arranged somewhat in the order that you would
proceed to diagnose any instrument problems. A set of scope pictures are supplied representative of the major
test points in the signal path. For a detailed description, also read the circuit descriptions in section P/N
130641-945."

sub as necessary."
4401XB-ORIT-AMO,Repair/Maintenance Procedures - 3.0 LAB ADJUSTMENTS,"LAB ADJUSTMENTS

There are no adjustments necessary to the 4401. When table data is requested from the 4401 the ground or
zero value of the A/D system is read (mux IC-7 on P/N 153908-000). When active channels are sampled the
zero reference value is subtracted from the sample prior to the sample being set up hole (This procedure
replaced the offset pot). Note when using ""send single channel"" the zero offset is not subtracted from the
acquired data.  The technician can evaluate the instruments true condition.

The gain correction of the A/D system is not done down hole. A precision reference source (IC-8 & R7 on
P/N 153910-000) is supplied to the surface as one of the A/D channels. Surface software can then correct
gain errors."

Remove the 4401 from the housing as per disassembly procedure P/N 130641-955. Connect a WTS PCM
or a 5721 Telemetry Test System (P/N 140175-000).  Use 4401 Test Program (P/N 156616-000).  If sensor
problems are anticipated remove the Tensor unit from the instrument. Place the Tensor module into its test
stand (P/N 089670-000) and connect to the 4401 with umbilical cable (P/N 132302-000).  Power the
instrument string to 180 Vac."

The 4401 electronics is functionally grouped on 3 circuit boards:

P/N 153908-100

P/N 153909-100
can be obtained by analyzing the tool status returned from the instrument.  If the instrument is not sufficiently
operational to acquire the status proceed to the digital troubleshooting section.  Tool status can be analyzed
as follows in section 7.0 Tool Status & Function.

TOOL STATUS & FUNCTION

Normal status is 0000. The high 8 bits should always be zero. The lower 8 bits indicate the following
problems.

1)
1xxx xxxx  SET ON POWER FAIL
2)

1.
The power fail bit is set if the power monitor (IC-3 on CPU board) detects that the 5 V power
is less than 4.75 V or it is not being reset from the CPU.

2.
On power up, and only on power up the internal RAM of the CPU (8751) is verified as
operational. if the test fails this bit is set.

3.
On power up the ROM check sum is calculated. If in error it is marked bad in the status byte.

4.
If more than 5 commands are addressed to the 4401 before they can be serviced the input
que will overflow and will be indicated by this status bit.

5.
When a EEROM table is uploaded it's checksum is checked. If the check sum is incorrect
it will be marked in the status.

6.
When the EEROM is accessed and does not respond for any reason it will mark this
malfunction in the status byte.

7.
If downloaded data is corrupted for any reason the CPU will time out and indicate the
incorrect data count by marking the MISSING DATA bit in the status byte.

8.
The A/D self test checks the A/D reference. If it is out of range the A/D FAIL bit will be set
in the status byte."

ANALOG TROUBLESHOOTING

The analog section of the 4401 is essentially contained on the analog board (P/N 153908-000).
A second multiplexer, Voltage reference and divider is located on the analog section of the CPU
board (P/N 153910-000).

Using drawing P/N 153910-000, locate a check the following input voltages using a fluke meter.

Using drawing P/N 153908-100 check each of the filters IC-1 through IC-6.

The filter input values correspond to the orientation sensor outputs and are in the range -4 V to +4 V.  The
output value should be within 1 millivolt of the corresponding input value. The sensor should be positioned
such that the voltage on the channel you are checking is at least 2 volts."

DIGITAL TROUBLESHOOTING"
4401XB-ORIT-AMO,Repair/Maintenance Procedures - 10.1 CPU,"CPU
(Reference drawing P/N 153910-100)

The first step in digital troubleshooting should be to verify that the CPU is powered up and in the idle loop.
This can be done by checking the following points on the CPU board.

1.
Check 5 Vdc on pin 40 of the CPU (IC-1)

2.
Check the master clock (12 mHz) from IC-2 is present on pin 19 of the CPU (Figure 956-35).

3.
Check that the CPU is not being held in reset. Pin 9 of the CPU should be low. If reset is high
or pulsing check the power monitor IC-3.



NOTE

The power monitor requires a feedback pulse from the CPU on the
WDI pin of IC-3.

4.
With no telemetry from the surface check the ""Pulse"" test point on the CPU board. See

5.
Select the single mode from the PC test program. Select GND0 from the menu. This will
continuously send 2 words down to the 4401 and receive a 1 word response. When telemetry
is being received by the CPU it is often not in the idle loop. This is indicated by the ""Pulse""
signal having a asymmetric shape as indicated in Figure 956-2."
4401XB-ORIT-AMO,Repair/Maintenance Procedures - REPAIR/MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES                            4401 WTS ORIENTATION TOOL 11.0 INPUT DATA PATH,"5





P/N 130641-956
NOVEMBER 2005 
INPUT DATA PATH
(Reference drawing P/N 153909-100)

1.
Check that the two words being sent from the surface are being received by the manchester.
Check IC-4, pin 8 for a signal similar to that of Figure 956-3.

2.
If the words are decoded by the manchester correctly you will get 2 valid signals from IC-4,
pin 1 (Figure 956-5).

3.
If valid is not present check that DR is not being held low and that the decoder clock (Figure
956-29) is correct and at 250 KHz. Check other Manchester signals as required.

4.
With valid signal ok, check that two ""take-data"" signals (Figure 956-6) and one command
sync signal (Figure 956-9) are correct. Check that command sync is being delayed properly
(Figure 956-10). It is necessary to delay command sync such that it is extended beyond the
time where TD goes low. This is latched at IC-5, pin 5, and becomes commsync.

5.
Once VALID is detected by the CPU the CPU will issue a read strobe for the MSB, LSB,
and commsync of the word just received (Figure 956-7, 8, 11).

6.
When the instrument address is decoded by the CPU the following command will be put into
the CPU received data queue (internal RAM). Anytime a word is put into the queue it will
be signaled to the outside by a pulse on pin 5 of the CPU IC-1 (Ref. drwg P/N 153910-100).
This lets the technician know that the CPU has actually accepted data from the manchester
and shift registers.

7.
Use the manchester timing diagram (Figure 945-3) to verify that VALID and TAKE DATA
have the proper timing and that TD is gating DSC to IC-6 and IC-9 of the telemetry board.

TD should also latch the shifted data from IC-6 into IC-7 and IC-9 into IC-10."
4401XB-ORIT-AMO,Repair/Maintenance Procedures - 12.0 OUTPUT DATA PATH,"OUTPUT DATA PATH
(Reference drawing P/N 153909-100)

With the surface simulator requesting the single A/D channel GND0 the 4401 instrument should be
returning one word to the surface (Figure 956-4).

1.
The CPU sends data by putting two 8 bit bytes of data onto the data bus and enables the
manchester.

2.
Check the data bus dbus0 through dbus7 for normal bus signature. Similar to Figure 956-32

typical rise time is 5 Micro sec.

3.
The CPU first writes to IC-8 (MSB Figure 956-12) then IC-11 (LSB Figure 956-13).

4.
WLSB also sets encoder enable (Figure 956-14) via the latch at IC-5. Once the manchester
starts SD (Figure 956-15) resets IC-3 and holds SB (Figure 956-16) active until the word

is sent.

5.
If multiple words are to be sent the output cycle starts over again."

1.
Check the A/D start pulse IC-9, pin 1 (Figure 956-18) on the analog board.

2.
Check the A/D clock for its relative timing IC-9, pin 24 (Figure 956-19), length (Figure
956-20) and shape (Figure 956-21).

3.
Check the output serial stream of the A/D IC-9, pin 3 (Figure 956-22).

4.
Check timing of the hold signal IC-4, pin 8 (Figure 956-23).

5.
Check that the Mux address corresponds to that selected."

4430XB-DHPA-AMO,Description of Service - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION


The 4430 XB Downhole Power Adapter is designed to provide large amounts of power (current)

for tool strings that demand it.  The 4430 XB provides 180 VAC and approximately 1.8 amps

for the STAR Imager tool string.  It can also be used in any tool string that uses 180 VAC and


consumes a maximum of 2.3 amps  of current.


The 4430 XB Downhole Power Adapter is made up of 3 transformers with the primary windings

wired in parallel and the secondary windings wired in parallel.  The three transformers wired in

parallel are designed to provide a 180 VAC output and a maximum current of 2.3 amps with

a 420 VAC input.


NOTE:

The cablehead voltage (CHV) recorded at the surface will be 180 VAC, (the voltage seen
at the bottom of the 4430 XB) while the voltage at the top of the 4430 XB will read 420 VAC.
A surface current meter will indicate 2.3 times less than at the bottom of the 4430 XB.


The 4430 XB Downhole Power Adapter must be the first tool in the tool string (i.e. attached

to the cablehead). If any tool is put between the cablehead and the 4430 XB, severe damage

to the tool can occur due to the 420 VAC at the cablehead."
4430XB-DHPA-AMO,Mechanical Description - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION


The 4430 XB Downhole Power Adapter is configured in one section, with a 10 pin female connector

on the uphole end and a 10 pin male connector on the downhole end.


NOTE:

DO NOT REPLACE THE 10-PIN CONNECTOR WITH A 28 PIN CONNECTOR.

(Reference drawings 191655-000 and 191653-100)


The 4430 XB houses three transformers in an aluminum clam-shell chassis.  The three transformers

are wired in parallel via terminals.  The primaries of the three transformers (T1, T2, and T3) are

connected in parallel to wireline conductors 1 and 4 on the uphole end of the tool, which are also

connected to pins A and D of the 10 pin connector J1.  The secondaries of the three transformers are

connected in parallel to wireline conductors 1 and 4 on the downhole end of the tool, which are also

connected to pins F and J of the 10 pin connector J2.  The center taps of the three transformers

on the line side are connected together and connected to downhole pin 9. The secondary are

connected together and left floating.


The feed-thru Conductors are 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.


The transformers are designed for an input voltage of 420 VAC which produces an output voltage

of 180 VAC. An input voltage of 420 VAC across J1 pins A and D produces an output voltage of

180 VAC across J2 pins F and J.


To determine the output current (current at the bottom of the 4430 XB) read the surface current from

the AC supply and multiply by 2.3.  The maximum input current to the 4430 XB is 1 amp which

produces 2.3 amps output."
4430XB-DHPA-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.0 DC RESISTANCE................................................................................................... 2,"DC RESISTANCE
(Reference drawings 191655-000 and 191653-100)


The primary DC resistance of the three parallel transformers can be measured across pins A and

D of the 10 pin connector J1.  The DC resistance should be approximately 7.7 Ω.


The secondary DC resistance of the three parallel transformers can be measured across pins F

and J of the 10 pin connector J2.  The DC resistance should be approximately 2.1 Ω."

Since the center taps of the three transformers (primary and secondary) are connected together, the

primary to secondary DC resistance of the three parallel transformers can be measured from pin A

of the 10 pin connector J1 to pin J of the 10 pin connector J2.  The DC resistance should be

approximately 5.1 Ω."

4430XB-DHPA-AMO,Lab Safety - 1.2 WARNINGS,"WARNINGS

DO NOT REPLACE THE 10-PIN CONNECTOR WITH A 28 PIN CONNECTOR.
THE 10-PIN CONNECTOR IS USED TO ASSURE THAT THE 4430 XB DPA CAN
ONLY BE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE CABLEHEAD.


THE CABLEHEAD VOLTAGE RECORDED AT THE SURFACE WILL BE 180 VAC,

(THE VOLTAGE SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 4430 XB) WHILE THE VOLTAGE

AT THE TOP OF THE 4430 XB WILL READ 420 VAC. A SURFACE CURRENT METER

WILL INDICATE 2.3 TIMES LESS THAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 4430 XB.

THE 4430 XB DOWNHOLE POWER ADAPTER MUST BE THE FIRST TOOL IN THE
TOOL STRING (I.E. ATTACHED TO THE CABLEHEAD).  IF ANY TOOL IS PUT

POWER SUPPLY CIRCUITRY
Three power supplies provide the necessary operating voltages for the 4490 XA
electronics.
The ±12 V supply provides power to circuits on: the analog board (A3002088000), the
orientation module (F119500000), and the analog section of the CPU board
(A3001307000).
The 5 V power supply provides power to the CPU, Telemetry, and A/D boards.

+5 V POWER SUPPLY
Refer to schematic F153911100.
The pink and tan windings of the transformer (T2) supply approximately 12 Vac to
bridge rectifier BR2. The resulting DC voltage is filtered by C6 and input to the 5-volt
regulator. The regulator output is delivered to the 5-volt bus. Noise immunity for the
regulator is provided by C5. Refer to Figure 1.

4490XA-ORIT-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 2.0 CPU BOARD................................................................................................................5,"CPU BOARD
Refer to schematic A3001307 SCH.
The CPU board contains two independent sections.
The Analog section is electrically isolated from the digital section and it is made up of U7
and U8. The multiplexer (U7) is paralleled with the Mux on the A/D board. This multiplexer
selects signals from the flask temperature and power supplies. The Analog section also
contains a 10 volt precision voltage source (U8). The voltage source is divided by R7 to a
precise 4799 mV and transferred to the main analog board to be used as a scale reference.
The digital section of the CPU board performs as follows:
U2 is the main oscillator supplying a 12 MHz clock to the CPU. U3 is a power-on reset
circuit that releases the CPU for operation when the 5 V supply exceeds 4.5 volts. U4 is a
serial EEROM that stores the tool asset number. This EEROM is wired for serial address 2
and is parallel via SCL and SDA with an identical part (address 0) embedded within the
sensor module.
U1 is a Intel 87 C51 Micro Controller incorporating RAM, EPROM, and I/O into a single 40-
pin DIP. I/O is divided between the 4 ports on the micro-controller are as follows:
Port 0
Port 0 emulates a bi-directional 8-bit data bus. U6 provides pull-up resistors for
the open drain outputs of port 0. The data bus leaves the CPU board via a 16-
conductor cable plugged into connector H1. The data bus goes directly to the
telemetry board and nowhere else. Read / Write control originates from port 2
and also leaves the CPU board to the telemetry board via H1.
Port 1 1. Supplies the A/D and sample/hold control signals, hold, start, and serial data bit.

2. Supplies the clock for the serial EEROM (SCL) and the bi-directional data bit
(SDA).

3. Also senses communication sync type (command/data) from the telemetry board.
Port 2
Port 2 supplies the 4-bit address used to control the 16-channel multiplexer.
These signals leave the CPU board and are routed to the analog board via 16-
conductor cable at H2.
Port 3 1. Supplies a watchdog reset bit to U3 (WDI).

2. Senses when the send buffer on the telemetry board is full.

3. Senses and generates a system interrupt when a valid word is received by the
telemetry board.

Pin 10 is configured as a digital input. When connected to ground subset 0 and F
are re-configured to provide both the internal and external flask temperature.

Refer to schematic F153909100.
The telemetry board contains a bus driver IC1, T1 and bus receiver IC2, T2. Manchester
IC4 encodes and decodes the serial data as it enters and leaves the board. IC12 is the 4
MHz telemetry oscillator. IC13 divides the oscillator to the correct Manchester
frequencies. IC3 is a latch that is set to start the encoder for a send transaction. Two
sections of buffer IC5 receive sync type. IC8 and IC11 form the send buffer. IC6, IC9,
IC7, and IC10 form the double buffer receive section."
4490XA-ORIT-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 3.1 SEND TRANSACTIONS ............................................................................................6,"SEND TRANSACTIONS
To send a word from the micro controller onto the instrument bus the following
transactions will occur. The MSB of the word being sent will be put onto the data bus.
Write MSB (WMSB) will pulse low (2 µs) to latch the data into IC8. The LSB of the
word to send will be put on the data bus. Write LSB (WLSB) will be pulsed low (2 µs) to
latch the data into IC11. WLSB also sets latch Q of IC3 and resets Q/ of IC3. Q/ of IC3
immediately sets send busy (SB) IC15 pin 8 indicating to the controller that telemetry is
now busy sending data. Q of IC3 sets encoder enable (EE) of the Manchester, which
initiates a send sequence. The Manchester begins sending sync to IC1 and to the
instrument bus. When the Manchester is ready to send the 16 bits of data previously
stored in shift registers IC8 and IC11 SD of IC4 goes high. SD going high does four
things.
1. IC15 is held busy independently of IC3.
2. IC3 clocks a low onto the Q output releasing EE. Q/ of IC3 releases pre-busy on pin
10 of IC15. SB remains in the busy state via IC15 pin 9.
3. SD at pin 1 of IC14 allows the encoder shift clock (ESC) to pass to the clock inputs
of shift registers IC8 and IC11. SD is connected to DR (Decoder Root).
4. SD going high resets the Manchester decoder effectively locking out all received
signals. When the16 data bits have been shifted out, SD goes low releasing send busy
(SB), which completes the send sequence.

Refer to schematic F153909100 and Figure 3.
When the 4401 is receiving a word on the instrument bus the following transactions
occur. As the word is received on the instrument bus it is transferred through T2 and IC2
to the UDI input of IC4. The sync type of the received word is determined and reflected
onto the CDS pin of I-4. At this point IC4 is ready to shift out serial data on the SDO pin
and indicates this by raising take data (TD). TD allows the DSC through IC14 to clock
the serial data stream into shift registers IC9 and IC6. The DSC is also clocking CDS into
IC5 effectively delaying CDS by one DSC clock cycle. When 16 bits have been shifted
in, TD goes low. TD going low latches the last value of CDS into IC5 pin 5. TD also
transfers the contents of shift registers IC6 and IC9 into tri-state latches IC7 and IC10.
The received word is now complete, the Manchester IC4 checks the parity bit on the
word just received, and if correct, it signals valid word (VW) on pin 1. VW is inverted,
and then leaves the telemetry board via J1 to the CPU. VW causes an interrupt at the
CPU. The word just received is read a byte at a time from IC7 and IC10 by the CPU
strobing RMSB and RLSB.

Note: If the CPU is busy it can take up to 500 microseconds between VW interrupt and when the

The outputs of accelerometers AX, AY, AZ and magnetometers MX, MY, MZ found in
orientation module F119500000 pass through the six channel filters (Figure 4) before
entering the 8-channel analog multiplexer. Filters designated U1 A through U6 A are
identical and have a cut-off frequency of 0.2 Hz. Each of the six filters has a gain of 1
(one) and is non-inverting.
Outputs from the orientation module depend on the earth's gravitational pull and
magnetic field present at the module. The module is scaled 3 volts/g for the
accelerometers and 8 volts/gauss for the magnetometers.



A/D SYSTEM
Refer to schematic A3002088 SCH.
Multiplexer U8 selects one of the six orientation vectors ground or scale reference. Mux
channel selection (channel 0-7) originates at the CPU and enters the analog board via a
16 conductor ribbon cable at J1. The Mux output is paralleled with an identical Mux on
the CPU board, connected via the MX2 terminal.
The output of the Mux is fed into buffer U7 A then into Vin of the A/D U9. U9 contains
an integral trac and hold to capture the selected signal while conversion takes place. All
timing originates at the CPU.

Note: The A/D clock only operates during an acquisition cycle and is OFF otherwise.

The third temperature sensor RTD100 is also located inside the housing flask (Zone 2) on
the power supply chassis in close proximity to RTD1000 and is connected to top sub pins
22 & 24 via flask cable A3001281000. This “passive” arrangement is read by connecting
a hand held meter to the top sub. The purpose of this measurement is to provide the

CIRCUIT OVERVIEW
The 4490 XA Orientation Sub is a general purpose borehole orientation instrument. It
continuously establishes the position of a tool string with respect to vertical and magnetic
north. It provides digital acquisition of three orthogonal accelerometers, three orthogonal
magnetometers, and temperature which comprises the sensor package. Additionally, several
in-circuit quality control points are monitored and reflected by the instrument status.. The
instrument returns data to the surface using the standard WTS communication protocol and
operates only on mode 2.
The 4490 XA instrument is similar in function and design to the 4401 XB orientation but is
rated for higher temperatures and pressures. The electronics and sensor are packaged within a
flasked pressure housing with the addition of both active and passive temperature sensors to
provide real time monitoring of the electronics environment and provide estimates of
remaining operating time down hole.
The 4490 XA is composed of six circuit categories:
•
Power Supply
•
CPU5
•
Telemetry
•
A/D Reference
•
Vector Filter
•
Temperature Monitoring
The instrument requires +5 volts and ±12 volts, both supplied by the power supply section.
The power supply is located on the main chassis.
The 4490 XA operates as a demand-response system that uses WTS mode 2 protocol.
Telemetry encoding, decoding, line drivers, and receivers are located on the telemetry board
(F153909000) on the main chassis.
The Analog board (within the heat flask) filters, multiplexes, and digitizes the six sensor
vector outputs.
The CPU (within the heat flask) controls the instrument functions of telemetry, analog
acquisition, and tool address decoding.

TEMPERATURE BOARD
Refer to drawing A3000853000 and schematic diagram A3000853 SCH.
The purpose of this board is to convert the temperature sensed by RTD2 located on the
power supply chassis to a voltage. This voltage is supplied to a mux-A/D located on the
T2 communications board to be digitized and sent to the surface.
This board is powered from 24 Vdc supplied to terminal VIN. This 24 V is regulated down
to 5.1 Vdc by R1 and Zener D1. The resulting voltage is the supply for op amp U2 and
reference U3. Temperature sensor RTD2, a platinum 1000 ohm RTD is connected via
terminals Temp+ and Temp-. U3 provides a fixed voltage reference of 4.096 volts to the
input of U2 B, a voltage to current conversion circuit. The current supplied to the load
(RTD2) is IL = Vi/R3 or I=4.096/10k = 0.4096 ma. This current in conjunction with
RTD2 generates a voltage proportional to temperature. IC UB2 amplifies TEMP+ input

Description of Service 
1 General 
The MicroVertilog (VRTM or MVRT) service utilizes magnetic flux leakage (MFL) inspection 
technology to determine the location, extent, and severity of corrosion and other metal-loss defects 
in carbon steel tubulars. 
MicroVertilog tools employ a permanent-magnet circuit designed to produce high levels of magnetic 
flux within the tubing or casing body wall. Defects, such as internal or external corrosion pitting, 
cause flux perturbations (leakage) that are detected by a circumferential array of inductive coil (FL) 
sensors.  
The MicroVertilog tools also employ a circumferential array of discriminator (DIS) sensors, each 
aligned with a corresponding FL sensor, that respond only to flux anomalies occurring at the 
tubing’s inner surface. This combination of FL and DIS data allows the MicroVertilog to differentiate 
between internal and external features.  
The MicroVertilog system produces digital bipolar waveforms, allowing metal gain anomalies 
(centralizers, downhole hardware) verses metal loss (corrosion, mill defects) to be determined from 
the log signature. The preferred vertical data sampling resolution is 0.125 inches, or approximately 
8 samples per inch, per sensor at the recommended logging speed of 120 ft./min. 
The MicroVertilog mandrels currently operate within five different instrument series to cover the full 
range of nominal tubing/casing sizes indicated in the following sections.

magnetizer kit for 7-5/8-inch and 7-3/4-inch casing. 
 A power and ground feed-thru version of this mandrel is available to allow running wireline 
power to an instrument below the 4914. The 4911/4914 would be run on internal battery power 
when using the feed-thru. 
 
The MicroVertilog tools are configured such that the FL sensors are all housed within a smooth 
cylindrical mandrel with dynamic wheeled centralizers located above and below the mandrel. The 
DIS sensors are conveyed to the tubing ID via spring-loaded shoe assemblies to maintain close 
proximity to the tubing inner wall during logging. 
2 Telemetry Mode 
The MicroVertilog electronics/telemetry system (4911 EB or 4911 EG) is designed to operate in one 
of three data acquisition modes, allowing for differences in wireline communication rates, operating 
conditions and deployment methods.  
In Wireline Telemetry Mode, a single conductor wireline (or 1 of 7 in the case of multiconductor) is 
required to supply tool power and transmit 100% of the log data to the PC based surface acquisition 
system. A “real-time” data display including all configured channels is presented on the system 
monitor during logging. Wireline Telemetry Mode is the preferred method of operation where 
wireline data transmission rates will allow. 
3 Full Memory Mode 
The second method of operation, Full Memory Mode, utilizes onboard memory for data storage and 
an onboard battery pack for tool power.  In Full Memory Mode, the downhole components do no not 
require any power or data communication to the surface system for logging operations, allowing the 
service to be run on slickline or sour service cables with reduced data transmission characteristics.  
A surface setup routine provides the downhole tool with all of the logging parameters prior to the 
job, and synchronizes the downhole tool and surface system processor clocks.  An encoder file 
(time vs. depth) acquired at the surface, and the downhole log file (data vs. depth) are merged post 
job to produce the final log presentation. While in Memory Mode, the logging engineer is essentially 
running “blind” with no surface data display. Memory operation is recommended for sour service 
applications or any application where slickline operation or coiled tubing conveyance is preferred.

4 Dual Mode 
The third mode of operation is Dual Mode (Mixed Mode), whereby power is supplied to the tool via 
a single-conductor wireline during logging operations, and the complete data file is recorded to the 
onboard memory module. In Dual Mode, a fractional sample of the data being sent to onboard 
memory is also transmitted via telemetry to the surface system for “real-time” display. In this way, 
Dual Mode allows full resolution data to be recorded to memory while a decimated data sampling is 
sent to the surface, thereby eliminating the “blind” run necessary in Full Memory Mode. Dual Mode 
is recommended for applications where single conductor wireline will not support the data 
transmission rates required for Telemetry Mode operations, or otherwise whenever a surface 
display is desired but Telemetry mode is not possible."

6 Description of Circuits 
6.1 General Description 
The MUX24-R is the second generation MicroVertilog electronics circuit board set and electronics 
architecture.  The Digital board (MUX24 D-R) is the primary system circuit board used in the 
4911 EB (F130673000) and 4911 EG (F131905000).  The MUX24 D-R controls the MUX24 analog 
board (MUX24 A-R), formats the data and sends the information up the wireline.  Additionally, during 
dual-mode or full-memory mode operation, the MUX24 D-R serves to store the system and sensor 
data to its on-board flash memory, where it can be downloaded from the electronics to a surface PC 
upon return of the MicroVertilog tool string to the surface. 
The MUX24 D-R circuit board assembly is shown below in Figure 1.

6.2.1 Voltage Clamp 
The voltage clamp consists of R8, R9, CR1, & Q1.  The voltage clamp keeps the wire line voltage 
that feeds the 12 V power supply from exceeding 37 volts.  R8 keeps PNP transistor Q1 turned off 
until the zener voltage is reached.  When the wire line voltage exceeds the zener by more than 
0.7 V, this will cause current to flow through the Emitter – Base junction of the transistor, turning the 
transistor on and clamping the voltage at ≈ 37 volts. 
6.2.2 Battery Switches 
The battery switches consist of 2 high side power MOSFET switches, IC U16 & U17.  The switches 
are turned ON & OFF by the system processor for logging when there is no wire line available.   
The output of the switches can be checked at TP13 (BATT1), TP14 (BATT2) & GND. 
6.2.3 Power Supplies 
The power supply section is made up of 5 different supplies.  When power is supplied by the wire 
line or batteries the first regulator (U18) is a PWM buck step-down regulator. It has a maximum 
input voltage of 42 VDC and the output set to 12 V by resistors R23 & R22.  This regulator is the 
main supply for the board and the other regulators.  The 12 V output can be checked at TP28. 
Regulator U12 is the same one used for U18 and takes the voltage from 12 V to 6 VDC.  It voltage is 
set by R18 & R17.  The 6 V can be checked at TP15. 
VR1 is a fixed LDO linear regulator.  Its input voltage is 6 V and the output is 5 V.  The 5 V can be 
checked at TP21. 
VR2 is the same series LDO as VR1.  Its input voltage is 5 V and the output is 3.3 VDC.  The 3.3 V 
can be checked at TP22. 
U4 is a regulated, adjustable 2x inverting charge pump. It is used to convert & regulate the 5 V input 
to -6 V out.  The output is set by R11 & R10.  Its output can be checked at TP16. 
6.2.4 Wireline Communication Interface (PHY) 
The PHY has 2 sections, the receive section and the transmit section.  The front end of the PHY 
has C1 & T1 for wire line isolation, TS2 (a TVS for voltage clamping) and R1 for impedance 
matching.  The receiving section uses U1 for demodulation, U2, U15 and diodes for wave form 
amplification, shaping / squaring, and TTL level forming.  After the received signal has been re-
squared to TTL levels it can then be sent to the communication processor and the system 
processor. 
The transmit section receives serial data and clock signals from the communication processor and 
clocks the serial data through U11 B NAND Gate and U3 D Flip-Flop.  U11 C & D receive the serial 
data and the signal from U3 and form a differential signal for the FET driver IC U10.  U10 drives 
transformer T1 to place the serial data on the wire line through capacitor C1. 
6.2.5 Communication Processor 
The communication processor U13 connects to the PHY and handles all the communications over-
head, serial-to-parallel & parallel-to-serial data, baud rate, CRC generation & checking, for the 
system processor.

6.2.6 System Processor 
The system processor U14 controls the Digital & Analog Boards.  The system processor controls 
the channel scanning, the A/D conversions on the analog board.  It receives the telemetry data, 
stores the received data in the FLASH memory, and controls the communication processor for 
sending and receiving information on the wire line.  The system processor is programmed through 
connector PGM8515. 
6.2.7 Flash Memory 
The memory section consists of the 2 Gbit NAND Flash IC, U7 & U8 buffer IC’s, and the U6 OR 
Gate for setting the data direction.  The flash memory connects to the system processor and the 
communication IC through the buffer IC’s.  The Flash memory stores the logging data, battery 
voltages, wire line voltage, temperature, and telemetry data from the Analog board and the 
telemetry processor.   
6.2.8 Telemetry 
Telemetry section consists of a 3 axis accelerometer IC (ACC1) and microprocessor U9.  The 
output from the accelerometers will be 1.65 V when the axis (X / Y / Z) being tested is at a null 
angle, 2.31 V for + g’s, and 0.99 V for – g’s, with respect to earth’s surface. The voltage for each axis 
can be checked at TP26 (X axis), TP25 (Y axis), TP24 (Z axis).  The microprocessor reads the 
accelerometers and converters the voltage to an angle which is then sent to the system processor 
by the SPI port.  The telemetry processor is programmed through connector PGM8.

6 Description of Circuits 
6.1 General Description 
The MUX24-R is the second generation MicroVertilog electronics circuit board set and electronics 
architecture.  The Analog board (MUX24 A-R) is the system circuit board used in the 4911 EB 
(F130673000) and 4911 EG (F131905000) to collect data from the MicroVertilog mandrels’ passive 
coil sensors (4912, 4913, 4914, 4915, 4917).  Additionally, once the data is collected from the coils, 
the MUX24 A-R board converts the analog signals to digital signals prior to passing the data to the 
MUX24 D-R board for storage and/or wireline transmission to the surface.  The general function of 
the MUX24 A-R Analog board is therefore to read the coil sensors in the mandrels, filter the signals, 
amplify the signals, digitize the signals and then send those digitized values to the MUX24 D-R 
Digital board. 
The MUX24 A-R circuit board assembly is shown below in Figure 1.

6.2.1 Filters 
The filters are simple RC filters consisting of resister networks RN10 - RN13, RN15 - RN19, RN21 
& capacitor networks CN2 - CN11. The filters filter out high frequency noise, (> 10 KHz), on the 
input lines. 
6.2.2 Multiplexers 
The multiplexers are controlled by the MUX24 digital board, and are used to select what input to 
send to the amplifier and A/D.  There are 32 hall inputs and 8 axillary inputs.  The multiplexer 
circuits consist of one D-latch (U22), used to select the multiplexer and input to send to the amplifier 
and A/D.  The multiplexers are U23, U24, U28, U29 (coil sensor inputs), and U27 for the auxiliary 
inputs. 
6.2.3 Amplifier Section 
The amplifier section has two op-amps, a ground switch, a latch, and an 8-to-1 multiplexer.  Op-
amp U31 A is a buffer for input signal to the U31 B op-amp.  Latch U21 is connected to multiplexer 
U1 for switching different resistors into op-amp U31 B to changes its gain from 0 to 8.0.  Switch U32 
is also controlled by latch U21 and switches in ground to the input of the buffer op-amp to measure 
offsets. 
6.2.4 Analog to Digital Converter Section (A/D) 
The A/D section has a 5 V regulator VR3 to supply 5 V to the A/D and a 2.5 V reference IC U25 to 
supply the reference to the A/D.  The A/D is a 12 bit converter.  It sends the data to the MUX24 
digital board through a serial link.

4911 EB Preventive Maintenance Level 3 
Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to provide the procedures necessary to perform Level 3 
Preventative Maintenance (PM3) on the 4911 EB Electronics Flask Assembly (F188606000).  
Scope 
The document is only applicable to the level 3 preventative maintenance procedures for the 
4911 EB Electronics Flask Assembly. This preventative maintenance procedure focuses on 
employee safety, environmentally sound practices, and/or troubleshooting. This procedure does not 
serve as a substitute for critical thought and the experience of the Baker Hughes representative. 
It is not intended to be an overriding document, meaning that all local, customer, governmental, or 
occupational policies or procedures that are the most stringent must be followed. 
Responsibility and Authority 
These Preventative Maintenance Procedures are intended for use by Baker Hughes 
representatives qualified to perform the repairs and inspection tests as per the master qualifications 
list or competency list. The specific job title and reporting structure of the representative will be 
documented in the pre-job planning paperwork and defined prior to the beginning of each job.  
These procedures are to be performed and documented by qualified Assembly, Maintenance and 
Overhaul (AMO) personnel.  AMO management is responsible to schedule and ensure the 
performance of these procedures for each instrument on a routine basis as required per typical 
Baker Hughes PM frequency for downhole wireline equipment. 
Safety and Regulatory 
Safety is of primary importance in our operations. All of Baker Hughes management, employees, 
and contract employees have the responsibility to make the safety of ourselves and our co-workers 
a fundamental concern.  With this in mind the following has been compiled as a reference of the 
possible safety risks associated with this operation.  Refer to the Stop Work Authority and other 
related Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE&S) Enterprise Operational Controls located 
on the HSE&S Management System website or through BHOS. Always consider that if more than 
one safety rule or standard exists then always default to the most stringent.

Preventative Maintenance Level 3 Procedures 
Prior to beginning each step below, all parts should be thoroughly cleaned of any dirt, debris, 
residue or grease. 
1. F188606000 “ELECTRONICS FLASK ASSY, 4911 EB”: 
A. Remove the internal assemblies from the flask housing (F189415000) as per the 
disassembly procedures discussed in document F188606955.   
B. Inspect the flask housing (F189415000) for any signs of damage (dents, gouges, etc.) which 
could cause the flask to fail under external wellbore pressure.  Replace flask if damaged.  A 
heat test may be performed to verify the thermal performance of the flask following 
completion of the electronics test procedure by placing the completed 4911 EB into an oven 
and running at 150 degrees C for four hours.  The internal flask temperature (payload 
temperature) should stay below 75 degrees C at the end of four hours at 150 degrees C if 
the flask’s thermal performance is per specification. 
C. Carefully remove the single conductor top assembly (F189417000) from the flask housing 
(F189415000) and inspect the contact plunger assemblies (F854868000) to ensure the 
plunger does not bind up when compressed or get stuck when allowed to extend.  Replace 
the contact plungers if necessary.   
D. Disassemble the single conductor top assembly and replace the two sealing o-rings 
(F243095111 & F243095009).  Prior to re-assembly, coat the o-rings and grooves with 
Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature grease.   
E. Disassemble the electronics flask assembly sub chassis sections from one another by 
disconnecting the sections via the 39 conductor connector (F189328000, F265819000) 
joints. 
F. Check the 39 conductor connectors (F189328000, F265819000) which connect the internal 
sub-assemblies together and verify that they have not loosened from their mating 
components and that they are free from damage.  Check the wiring in the backside of the 
connectors to make sure that no wires are broken and that all sockets/pins are securely 
locked into the connectors.  Tighten, repair or replace as required. 
 
2. F188603000 “SEAL HEAD ASSY, 4911 EB” 
A. Replace the sealing o-rings (F243095130) on the seal head assembly (F188603000). Prior 
to assembly, coat the o-rings and grooves with Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature 
grease.  
B. Remove and inspect the 36 socket pressure bulkhead connector (F189391000) for bent, 
missing, or damaged connector pins. Straighten and repair bent pins if possible or replace 
connector.  
C. With a megohmeter, measure the insulation resistance between all connector pins and case 
(metal connector body).  Verify all conductors have insulation resistance greater than 1000 
MOhms.   
→ If leakage is present (< 1000 MOhms), soak the bulkhead connector in Isopropyl 
alcohol and allow to soak overnight.  Remove the bulkhead from the alcohol and allow to 
air dry.  Once the connector is dry, place it in an oven at 225 degrees Fahrenheit for one 
hour in order to drive off any remaining moisture in the connector.  Recheck step 5.  If 
insulation resistance is not restored to >1000 MOhms, replace the bulkhead connector.

D. Replace the sealing o-ring (F243095123) on the 36 socket pressure bulkhead connector 
(F189391000) within the seal head assembly (F188603000). Prior to assembly, coat the o-
ring and grooves with Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature grease. 
E. Inspect the seal head wiring assembly (F189429000) for loose or damaged components and 
check continuity of the wiring assembly’s conductors from end to end with a Fluke Multi-
meter set to measure resistance or continuity. Repair or replace components as necessary.  
F. Replace the sealing o-ring (F243095006) on the #4-40 socket head cap screw 
(F250339000) located within the seal head wiring assembly (F189429000). Prior to 
assembly, coat the o-ring and grooves with Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature 
grease. 
G. Remove the 4912 Split Collar assemblies (F188633000) from the seal head assembly.  
Inspect the threads and bearing surfaces for damage or excessive pitting corrosion.  
Replace as necessary.  Clean and re-lubricate the split collar assemblies with Lubriplate® or 
equivalent high temperature grease prior to re-installation.  Verify that the split collar spins 
freely without binding after installation back onto the seal head. 
 
3. F188604000 “INSULATOR/HEAT SINK/BATTERY ASSEMBLY, 4911 EB”: 
A. Replace the centralizing o-rings (F259262221) which hold the battery retainers 
(F189406000) on the 4911 EB Insulator/Heatsink/Battery Assembly (F188604000). DO NOT 
apply lubricant to the chassis centralizing o-rings. 
B. Inspect the 4911 EB Insulator/Heatsink/Battery Assembly (F188604000) for loose or 
damaged electrical connectors or parts. Repair or replace components if necessary.  
C. Verify that the 2 P-2 T Battery Switch (F265839000) is functioning properly.  Replace the 
switch if not performing properly.  
D. Closely inspect the battery pack wiring on the insulator/heat sink/battery chassis assembly 
for any signs of pinches, cuts or other damage.  Repair as required. 
E. Inspect the battery packs (F189827000), as shown in Figure 1 below, for signs of damage 
and then measure the voltage of the pack using a 100 Ohm, 10 W resistor between the 
terminals of the battery pack connector.  If the measured voltage is less than 27 V, de-
passivate (stir) the battery pack by holding the 100 Ohm, 10 W resistor across the battery 
terminals for five seconds at a time.  If the battery pack voltage will not increase, replace the 
battery pack with a new one.  Avoid using battery packs which have exceeded 2 years from 
their manufacture date.  Battery pack voltage can also be measured using a 4919 NA Test 
Box (see manual F140472915), but the above procedure is recommended to ensure the 
battery pack is loaded with some resistance when taking the voltage measurement.   
Note 1: A battery pack which measures zero volts is not a sign that the battery pack is 
depleted.  A depleted battery pack will still measure some voltage (perhaps as little as 1 
volt, but never zero).  A measurement of zero volts on the battery pack is a sign that the 
fuse (on the battery pack’s positive lead under shrink tubing) has blown or has been 
damaged.  If zero volts is measured, replace the blown fuse with a new fuse (FUSE, 
AXIAL, FAST-BLOW, 125 V, 1 A, 0.25 W; Manf: LITTLEFUSE, Manf. P/N: 0251001.MXL).

Note 2: if a full memory job is not planned, it is recommended to remove the battery 
packs from the 4911 EB to reduce the risk of fire in the electronics if the tool should be 
stuck downhole in a hot borehole environment.  The battery may catch fire, explode or 
rupture if its temperature exceeds 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). 
 
4. F188605000 “ELECTRONICS CHASSIS ASSEMBLY, 4911 EB”: 
A. Inspect the Electronics Chassis Assembly (F188605000) for loose electrical connectors and 
components that might have become dislodged during logging operations.  Repair or 
replace components as necessary. 
B. Replace the chassis centralizing o-rings (F259262221) on the Electronics Chassis Assembly 
(F188605000).  DO NOT apply lubricant to the chassis centralizing o-rings. 
C. Inspect the beryllium copper EMI Gasket (F265828000) for damage. Repair or replace the 
component if necessary.  Secure the #4-40 button head cap screw (F246124000) gasket 
fasteners DOW Corning 3145 silicone RTV or equivalent. 
D. Verify that the #4-40 fasteners (F208565000 & F230745000), which secure the electronics 
circuit boards to the chassis, are intact and tight.  Secure the screws in place with DOW 
Corning 3145 silicone RTV or equivalent. 
E. Inspect the printed circuit board assemblies (A3003301000 & A3003302000) to ensure that 
no components have come loose or show any signs of damage.  Verify that the circuit 
boards are free of contaminants or debris which could cause electrical shorting or arcing.  
Clean, repair or replace the PCB assemblies as required.  Damage or non-functional PCB 
assemblies should be replaced (find fault to board and replace – do not repair at PCB 
component level). 
F. Verify the connectors for the harnesses are securely seated into the headers on the circuit 
boards and secured in place with DOW Corning 3145 silicone RTV or equivalent. 
G. Inspect the chassis wiring harness (A3003317000) and board-to-board wiring harness 
(A3003318000) for any signs of damage.  Repair any wiring, connectors or contacts as 
required.  Verify the cable harnesses are secured to the PCBs and/or chassis with kapton

4912 / 4913 / 4914 / 4915 / 4917 MicroVertilog (VRTM) 
Description of Service 
1 General 
The MicroVertilog (VRTM or MVRT) service utilizes magnetic flux leakage (MFL) inspection 
technology to determine the location, extent, and severity of corrosion and other metal-loss defects 
in carbon steel tubulars. 
MicroVertilog tools employ a permanent-magnet circuit designed to produce high levels of magnetic 
flux within the tubing or casing body wall. Defects, such as internal or external corrosion pitting, 
cause flux perturbations (leakage) that are detected by a circumferential array of inductive coil (FL) 
sensors.  
The MicroVertilog tools also employ a circumferential array of discriminator (DIS) sensors, each 
aligned with a corresponding FL sensor, that respond only to flux anomalies occurring at the 
tubing’s inner surface. This combination of FL and DIS data allows the MicroVertilog to differentiate 
between internal and external features.  
The MicroVertilog system produces digital bipolar waveforms, allowing metal gain anomalies 
(centralizers, downhole hardware) verses metal loss (corrosion, mill defects) to be determined from 
the log signature. The preferred vertical data sampling resolution is 0.125 inches, or approximately 
8 samples per inch, per sensor at the recommended logging speed of 120 ft./min. 
The MicroVertilog mandrels currently operate within five different instrument series to cover the full 
range of nominal tubing/casing sizes indicated in the following sections.

1.1 4911 (Common VRTM Electronics Section) 
 The 4911 serves as the telemetry and data acquisition electronics for all VRTM instrument 
mandrels. Two versions exist, the 4911 EB (standard) and 4911 EG (feed-thru).   
 The 4911 EG version can receive wireline power and ground and pass this through the VRTM 
mandrel to another instrument attached below the VRTM tool (for example, a caliper or 
temperature tool). (MVRT would run on battery power when utilizing this feed-thru functionality). 
 Both 4911 versions can run on internal battery pack power in support of full memory logging via 
slick line, coiled tubing, or adverse wireline conditions. 
1.2 4912 (Nominal 2-7/8-Inch OD Tubing) 
The 4912 deploys an overlapping array of 6 FL and 6 DIS sensors, providing 100% circumferential 
coverage for internal and external anomalies. 
1.3 4913 (Nominal 3-1/2-Inch OD Tubing) 
 The 4913 deploys an overlapping array of 6 FL and 6 DIS sensors, providing 100% 
circumferential coverage for internal and external anomalies. 
 The 4913 can be reconfigured with the 4913 MB magnetizer kit for inspection of 4-inch OD 
casing. 
1.4 4914 (Nominal 4-1/2-Inch OD Tubing/Casing) 
 The 4914 deploys an overlapping array of 8 FL and 8 DIS sensors, providing 100% 
circumferential coverage for internal and external anomalies. 
 The 4914 can be reconfigured with the 4914 MB magnetizer kit for inspection of 5-inch OD 
casing. 
 A power and ground wire feed-thru version of this mandrel is available to allow running wireline 
power to an instrument below the 4914. The 4911/4914 would be run on internal battery power 
when using the feed-thru. 
1.5 4915 (Nominal 5-1/2-Inch OD Casing) 
 The 4915 deploys an overlapping array of 10 FL and 10 DIS sensors, providing 100% 
circumferential coverage for internal and external anomalies. 
 Due to the wide range of wellbore configurations and body walls encountered in 5-1/2-inch 
casing, three different 4915 magnetizers have been developed in the following magnetizer 
diameters: 
 
4.25” 4915 MA/(MD) 
 
4.50” 4915 MB/(ME) 
 
4.63” 4915 MC/(MF) 
 A power and ground wire feed-thru version of the 4915 mandrel is available to allow running 
wireline power to an instrument below the 4915.  The 4911 EG/4915 would be run on internal 
battery power when using the feed-thru.

1.6 4917 (Nominal 7-Inch OD Casing) 
 The 4917 deploys an overlapping array of 14 FL and 14 DIS sensors, providing 100% 
circumferential coverage for internal and external anomalies. 
 The 4917 can be reconfigured with a 4917 MB/(MF) magnetizer kit for inspection in 8-5/8-inch 
casing, a 4917 MC/(MG) magnetizer kit for inspection in 9-5/8-inch casing, or a 4917 MD/(MH) 
magnetizer kit for 7-5/8-inch and 7-3/4-inch casing. 
 A power and ground feed-thru version of this mandrel is available to allow running wireline 
power to an instrument below the 4914. The 4911/4914 would be run on internal battery power 
when using the feed-thru. 
 
The MicroVertilog tools are configured such that the FL sensors are all housed within a smooth 
cylindrical mandrel with dynamic wheeled centralizers located above and below the mandrel. The 
DIS sensors are conveyed to the tubing ID via spring-loaded shoe assemblies to maintain close 
proximity to the tubing inner wall during logging. 
2 Telemetry Mode 
The MicroVertilog electronics/telemetry system (4911 EB or 4911 EG) is designed to operate in one 
of three data acquisition modes, allowing for differences in wireline communication rates, operating 
conditions and deployment methods.  
In Wireline Telemetry Mode, a single conductor wireline (or 1 of 7 in the case of multiconductor) is 
required to supply tool power and transmit 100% of the log data to the PC based surface acquisition 
system. A “real-time” data display including all configured channels is presented on the system 
monitor during logging. Wireline Telemetry Mode is the preferred method of operation where 
wireline data transmission rates will allow. 
3 Full Memory Mode 
The second method of operation, Full Memory Mode, utilizes onboard memory for data storage and 
an onboard battery pack for tool power.  In Full Memory Mode, the downhole components do no not 
require any power or data communication to the surface system for logging operations, allowing the 
service to be run on slickline or sour service cables with reduced data transmission characteristics.  
A surface setup routine provides the downhole tool with all of the logging parameters prior to the 
job, and synchronizes the downhole tool and surface system processor clocks.  An encoder file 
(time vs. depth) acquired at the surface, and the downhole log file (data vs. depth) are merged post 
job to produce the final log presentation. While in Memory Mode, the logging engineer is essentially 
running “blind” with no surface data display. Memory operation is recommended for sour service 
applications or any application where slickline operation or coiled tubing conveyance is preferred.

4 Dual Mode 
The third mode of operation is Dual Mode (Mixed Mode), whereby power is supplied to the tool via 
a single-conductor wireline during logging operations, and the complete data file is recorded to the 
onboard memory module. In Dual Mode, a fractional sample of the data being sent to onboard 
memory is also transmitted via telemetry to the surface system for “real-time” display. In this way, 
Dual Mode allows full resolution data to be recorded to memory while a decimated data sampling is 
sent to the surface, thereby eliminating the “blind” run necessary in Full Memory Mode. Dual Mode 
is recommended for applications where single conductor wireline will not support the data 
transmission rates required for Telemetry Mode operations, or otherwise whenever a surface 
display is desired but Telemetry mode is not possible."

6 Description of Circuits 
6.1 General Description 
The MUX24-R is the second generation MicroVertilog electronics circuit board set and electronics 
architecture.  The Digital board (MUX24 D-R) is the primary system circuit board used in the 
4911 EB (F130673000) and 4911 EG (F131905000).  The MUX24 D-R controls the MUX24 analog 
board (MUX24 A-R), formats the data and sends the information up the wireline.  Additionally, during 
dual-mode or full-memory mode operation, the MUX24 D-R serves to store the system and sensor 
data to its on-board flash memory, where it can be downloaded from the electronics to a surface PC 
upon return of the MicroVertilog tool string to the surface. 
The MUX24 D-R circuit board assembly is shown below in Figure 1.

6.2.1 Voltage Clamp 
The voltage clamp consists of R8, R9, CR1, & Q1.  The voltage clamp keeps the wire line voltage 
that feeds the 12 V power supply from exceeding 37 volts.  R8 keeps PNP transistor Q1 turned off 
until the zener voltage is reached.  When the wire line voltage exceeds the zener by more than 
0.7 V, this will cause current to flow through the Emitter – Base junction of the transistor, turning the 
transistor on and clamping the voltage at ≈ 37 volts. 
6.2.2 Battery Switches 
The battery switches consist of 2 high side power MOSFET switches, IC U16 & U17.  The switches 
are turned ON & OFF by the system processor for logging when there is no wire line available.   
The output of the switches can be checked at TP13 (BATT1), TP14 (BATT2) & GND. 
6.2.3 Power Supplies 
The power supply section is made up of 5 different supplies.  When power is supplied by the wire 
line or batteries the first regulator (U18) is a PWM buck step-down regulator. It has a maximum 
input voltage of 42 VDC and the output set to 12 V by resistors R23 & R22.  This regulator is the 
main supply for the board and the other regulators.  The 12 V output can be checked at TP28. 
Regulator U12 is the same one used for U18 and takes the voltage from 12 V to 6 VDC.  It voltage is 
set by R18 & R17.  The 6 V can be checked at TP15. 
VR1 is a fixed LDO linear regulator.  Its input voltage is 6 V and the output is 5 V.  The 5 V can be 
checked at TP21. 
VR2 is the same series LDO as VR1.  Its input voltage is 5 V and the output is 3.3 VDC.  The 3.3 V 
can be checked at TP22. 
U4 is a regulated, adjustable 2x inverting charge pump. It is used to convert & regulate the 5 V input 
to -6 V out.  The output is set by R11 & R10.  Its output can be checked at TP16. 
6.2.4 Wireline Communication Interface (PHY) 
The PHY has 2 sections, the receive section and the transmit section.  The front end of the PHY 
has C1 & T1 for wire line isolation, TS2 (a TVS for voltage clamping) and R1 for impedance 
matching.  The receiving section uses U1 for demodulation, U2, U15 and diodes for wave form 
amplification, shaping / squaring, and TTL level forming.  After the received signal has been re-
squared to TTL levels it can then be sent to the communication processor and the system 
processor. 
The transmit section receives serial data and clock signals from the communication processor and 
clocks the serial data through U11 B NAND Gate and U3 D Flip-Flop.  U11 C & D receive the serial 
data and the signal from U3 and form a differential signal for the FET driver IC U10.  U10 drives 
transformer T1 to place the serial data on the wire line through capacitor C1. 
6.2.5 Communication Processor 
The communication processor U13 connects to the PHY and handles all the communications over-
head, serial-to-parallel & parallel-to-serial data, baud rate, CRC generation & checking, for the 
system processor.

6.2.6 System Processor 
The system processor U14 controls the Digital & Analog Boards.  The system processor controls 
the channel scanning, the A/D conversions on the analog board.  It receives the telemetry data, 
stores the received data in the FLASH memory, and controls the communication processor for 
sending and receiving information on the wire line.  The system processor is programmed through 
connector PGM8515. 
6.2.7 Flash Memory 
The memory section consists of the 2 Gbit NAND Flash IC, U7 & U8 buffer IC’s, and the U6 OR 
Gate for setting the data direction.  The flash memory connects to the system processor and the 
communication IC through the buffer IC’s.  The Flash memory stores the logging data, battery 
voltages, wire line voltage, temperature, and telemetry data from the Analog board and the 
telemetry processor.   
6.2.8 Telemetry 
Telemetry section consists of a 3 axis accelerometer IC (ACC1) and microprocessor U9.  The 
output from the accelerometers will be 1.65 V when the axis (X / Y / Z) being tested is at a null 
angle, 2.31 V for + g’s, and 0.99 V for – g’s, with respect to earth’s surface. The voltage for each axis 
can be checked at TP26 (X axis), TP25 (Y axis), TP24 (Z axis).  The microprocessor reads the 
accelerometers and converters the voltage to an angle which is then sent to the system processor 
by the SPI port.  The telemetry processor is programmed through connector PGM8.

6 Description of Circuits 
6.1 General Description 
The MUX24-R is the second generation MicroVertilog electronics circuit board set and electronics 
architecture.  The Analog board (MUX24 A-R) is the system circuit board used in the 4911 EB 
(F130673000) and 4911 EG (F131905000) to collect data from the MicroVertilog mandrels’ passive 
coil sensors (4912, 4913, 4914, 4915, 4917).  Additionally, once the data is collected from the coils, 
the MUX24 A-R board converts the analog signals to digital signals prior to passing the data to the 
MUX24 D-R board for storage and/or wireline transmission to the surface.  The general function of 
the MUX24 A-R Analog board is therefore to read the coil sensors in the mandrels, filter the signals, 
amplify the signals, digitize the signals and then send those digitized values to the MUX24 D-R 
Digital board. 
The MUX24 A-R circuit board assembly is shown below in Figure 1.

6.2.1 Filters 
The filters are simple RC filters consisting of resister networks RN10 - RN13, RN15 - RN19, RN21 
& capacitor networks CN2 - CN11. The filters filter out high frequency noise, (> 10 KHz), on the 
input lines. 
6.2.2 Multiplexers 
The multiplexers are controlled by the MUX24 digital board, and are used to select what input to 
send to the amplifier and A/D.  There are 32 hall inputs and 8 axillary inputs.  The multiplexer 
circuits consist of one D-latch (U22), used to select the multiplexer and input to send to the amplifier 
and A/D.  The multiplexers are U23, U24, U28, U29 (coil sensor inputs), and U27 for the auxiliary 
inputs. 
6.2.3 Amplifier Section 
The amplifier section has two op-amps, a ground switch, a latch, and an 8-to-1 multiplexer.  Op-
amp U31 A is a buffer for input signal to the U31 B op-amp.  Latch U21 is connected to multiplexer 
U1 for switching different resistors into op-amp U31 B to changes its gain from 0 to 8.0.  Switch U32 
is also controlled by latch U21 and switches in ground to the input of the buffer op-amp to measure 
offsets. 
6.2.4 Analog to Digital Converter Section (A/D) 
The A/D section has a 5 V regulator VR3 to supply 5 V to the A/D and a 2.5 V reference IC U25 to 
supply the reference to the A/D.  The A/D is a 12 bit converter.  It sends the data to the MUX24 
digital board through a serial link.

8 Preventative Maintenance Level 3 Procedures 
Prior to beginning each step below, all parts should be thoroughly cleaned of any dirt, debris, 
residue or grease. 
1. A3003392000 “ELECTRONICS FLASK ASSY, 4911 EG”: 
A. Remove the internal assemblies from the flask housing (F189415000) as per the 
disassembly procedures discussed in document A3003392955.   
B. Inspect the flask housing (F189415000) for any signs of damage (dents, gouges, etc.) 
which could cause the flask to fail under external wellbore pressure.  Replace flask if 
damaged.  A heat test may be performed to verify the thermal performance of the flask 
following completion of the electronics test procedure by placing the completed 4911 EG 
into an oven and running at 150 degrees C for four hours.  The internal flask 
temperature (payload temperature) should stay below 75 degrees C at the end of four 
hours at 150 degrees C if the flask’s thermal performance is per specification. 
C. Carefully remove the 4911 EG standard single conductor top assembly (A3003393000) 
from the flask housing (F189415000) and inspect the contact plunger assemblies 
(F854868000) to ensure the plunger does not bind up when compressed or get stuck 
when allowed to extend.  Replace the contact plungers if necessary.   
D. Disassemble the single conductor top assembly and replace the two sealing o-rings 
(F243095111 & F243095009).  Prior to re-assembly, coat the o-rings and grooves with 
Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature grease.   
E. Disassemble the electronics flask assy internal sub chassis sections from one another 
by disconnecting the sections via the 39 conductor connector (F189328000, 
F265819000) joints. 
F. Check the 39 conductor connectors (F189328000, F265819000) which connect the 
internal sub-assemblies together and verify that they have not loosened from their 
mating components and that they are free from damage.  Check the wiring in the 
backside of the connectors to make sure that no wires are broken and that all 
sockets/pins are securely locked into the connectors.  Tighten, repair or replace as 
required. 
2. A3003397000 “SEAL HEAD ASSY, 4911 EG” 
A. Replace the sealing o-rings (F243095130) on the seal head assembly (A3003397000). 
Prior to assembly, coat the o-rings and grooves with Lubriplate® or equivalent high 
temperature grease.  
B. Remove and inspect the 36 socket pressure bulkhead connector (F189391000) for bent, 
missing, or damaged connector pins. Straighten and repair bent pins if possible or 
replace connector.  
C. With a megohmeter, measure the insulation resistance between all connector pins and 
case (metal connector body).  Verify all conductors have insulation resistance greater 
than 1000 MOhms. 
If leakage is present (< 1000 MOhms), soak the bulkhead connector in Isopropyl 
alcohol and allow to soak overnight.  Remove the bulkhead from the alcohol, 
carefully scrub with a soft bristle brush and allow to air dry.  Once the connector 
is dry, place it in an oven at 225 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour in order to drive 
off any remaining moisture in the connector.  Recheck step 5.  If insulation 
resistance is not restored to >1000 MOhms, replace the bulkhead connector.

D. Replace the sealing o-ring (F243095123) on the 36 socket pressure bulkhead connector 
(F189391000) within the seal head assembly (A3003397000). Prior to assembly, coat 
the o-ring and grooves with Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature grease. 
E. Inspect the seal head wiring assembly (F189429000) for loose or damaged components 
and check continuity of the wiring assembly’s conductors from end to end with a Fluke 
Multi-meter set to measure resistance or continuity. Repair or replace components as 
necessary.  
F. Replace the sealing o-ring (F243095006) on the #4-40 socket head cap screw 
(F250339000) located within the seal head wiring assembly (F189429000). Prior to 
assembly, coat the o-ring and grooves with Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature 
grease. 
G. Remove the 4912 Split Collar assemblies (F188633000) from the seal head assembly.  
Inspect the threads and bearing surfaces for damage or excessive pitting corrosion.  
Replace as necessary.  Clean and re-lubricate the split collar assemblies with 
Lubriplate® or equivalent high temperature grease prior to re-installation.  Verify that the 
split collar spins freely without binding after installation back onto the seal head. 
3. A3003396000 “INSULATOR/HEAT SINK/BATTERY ASSEMBLY, 4911 EG”: 
A. Replace the centralizing o-rings (F259262221) which hold the battery retainers 
(F189406000) on the 4911 EG Insulator/Heatsink/Battery Assembly (A3003396000). DO 
NOT apply lubricant to the chassis centralizing o-rings. 
B. Inspect the 4911 EG Insulator/Heatsink/Battery Assembly (A3003396000) for loose or 
damaged electrical connectors or parts. Repair or replace components if necessary.  
C. Verify that the 2 P-2 T Battery Switch (F265839000) is functioning properly.  Replace the 
switch if not performing properly. (Refer to the procedures in the 4919 NA manual, 
document no. F140472915).  Also, verify the socket head cap screws which retain the 
switch are secured with DOW Corning 3145 Silicone RTV. 
D. Closely inspect the battery pack wiring on the insulator/heat sink/battery chassis 
assembly for any signs of pinches, cuts or other damage.  Repair as required. 
E. Inspect the battery packs (F189827000), as shown in Figure 1 below, for signs of 
damage and then measure the voltage of the pack using a 100 Ohm, 10 W resistor 
between the terminals of the battery pack connector.  If the measured voltage is less 
than 27 V, de-passivate (stir) the battery pack by holding the 100 Ohm, 10 W resistor 
across the battery terminals for five seconds at a time.  If the battery pack voltage will 
not increase, replace the battery pack with a new one.  Avoid using battery packs which 
have exceeded 2 years from their manufacture date.  Battery pack voltage can also be 
measured using a 4919 NA Test Box (see manual F140472915), but the above 
procedure is recommended to ensure the battery pack is loaded with some resistance 
when taking the voltage measurement. 
 
 
Note 
 
A battery pack which measures zero volts is not a sign that the 
battery pack is depleted.  A depleted battery pack will still measure 
some voltage (perhaps as little as 1 volt, but never zero).  A 
measurement of zero volts on the battery pack is a sign that the 
fuse (on the battery pack’s positive lead under shrink tubing) has 
blown or has been damaged.  If zero volts are measured, replace 
the blown fuse with a new fuse (FUSE, AXIAL, FAST-BLOW, 125 V, 
1 A, 0.25 W; Manf: LITTLEFUSE, Manf. P/N: 0251001.MXL).

Note 
 
If a full memory job is not planned, it is recommended to remove the 
battery packs from the 4911 EG to reduce the risk of fire in the 
electronics if the tool should be stuck downhole in a hot borehole 
environment. The battery may catch fire, explode or rupture if its 
temperature exceeds 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). 
 
 
 
4. A3003391000 “ELECTRONICS CHASSIS ASSEMBLY, 4911 EG”: 
A. Inspect the Electronics Chassis Assembly (A3003391000) for loose electrical connectors 
and components which may have become dislodged or damaged during transport or 
logging operations.  Repair or replace components as necessary. 
B. Replace the chassis centralizing o-rings (F259262221) on the Electronics Chassis 
Assembly (A3003391000).  DO NOT apply lubricant to the chassis centralizing o-rings.

calibration/characaterization it should be sent to the vendor indicated for that purpose.
Certain components are critical and their replacement must be followed by calibration /
characterization.  The critical components are itemized in MISCELLANEOUS DATA section.
The Temperature / Pressure electronics must be operated under dynamic conditions to obtain the
data necessary for characterization.  Characterization generates sets of coefficients that are used in
third and fourth order equations for curve fitting.

PROCEDURE FOR 8255 XA TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE CHARACTERIZATION
CALIBRATION SET-UP
These set-up procedures are required to dynamically test and retrieve data sufficient for generating the required
coefficients.
Assembly Drawing B 152665-002 / 5 of 5 illustrates the set-up configuration.  There are certain changes
which must be performed on the instrument before it is ready for characterization.  These changes are
described in specification AWS #152665-001.
This newly configured instrument is then connected to a calibration cable (AWS #156233-000) that interfaces
to a power supply and several frequency counters.
Pressure is applied via the pressure ports which interface the instrument to the dead weight tester.  A crossover
fitting ( / "" NPT male) connection is installed for mating to the dead weight tester.  The temperature bath is
1
4
oil filled and stabilized to +_0.2 F before data is taken.
o
The circuitry is powered by applying +150 Volts DC (+_ 1 V) and ground to the appropriate yellow and black
wires of the calibration cable.  Current draw should be approximately 65 mA.
There is no pressure-tight seal through which the power and signal wires are routed and therefore the top of
the instrument must be kept above the surface of the oil bath.
The oil bath temperature should be well regulated and the electronics allowed to come to thermal equilibrium
before measurements are recorded.  One method of determining this equilibrium is to monitor the Temperature
and the RTD frequency outputs.
When they cease to drift or drift less than five hertz per hour, then equilibrium can be considered adequate for
measurement readings.   Insure that the bottom of the instrument is sealed to prohibit fluid entry before
submerging into the bath.
A very high-quality dead weight tester should be used to generate accurate and stable pressures.  It is required
that the dead weight tester have NIST traceability.  The weight table should be floating properly and pressures
allowed to stabilize.  Allow 5 minutes after stabilizing before recording the three frequency readings.
NOTE: At any time, if the pressure transducer is removed from the mandrel, its O-ring (07) should be replaced.
Also, be sure to use a calibrated torque wrench to re-install it.  The makeup torque of the pressure transducer
is 40 lbs ± 5.0 lbs .

REPAIR  /  MAINTENANCE  PROCEDURES -  8255 XA  TEMPERATURE / PRESSURE TOOL

INITIAL CHECK
This section is to quickly determine if the frequency readings are within a reasonable range before starting.
The electronic circuitry consists of three separate circuits which output three separate frequencies.  Each
output has its own ground connection to eliminate any crosstalk.
The borehole temperature circuit outputs a pulse rate that is approximately ten times the sensed temperature
in degrees Fahrenheit (i.e. - 150 F will have an output near 1500 Hz.)  This output value is not critical because
o
real values will be recorded during calibration.  It is mentioned only to provide an guideline as to whether the
circuitry is operating correctly.
The internal temperature of the pressure sensor circuit has an output approximately ten times the sensed
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
The pressure circuit output frequency has an initial offset value at zero pressure.  Added to this offset is the
frequency representative of the applied pressure and is approximately 4 Hz/PSI.  Each output should be
measured on a good-quality frequency counter with a gate time of no less than one second.
CALIBRATION
For characterization purposes, both temperature and pressure measurements should be taken at the following
temperatures: 100 F, 150 F, 200 F, 250 F, 300 F,  325 F, and 350 F.
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
The recording of a NIST traceable temperature standard measuring the oil bath temperature should accompany
the frequency readings.
Pressure frequency data should be recorded for the following pressures (in PSI), first ascending and then
descending, zero or atmospheric pressure; 1,000 up to 15,000 PSI and then back down to zero in 2,000 PSI
steps.
The data should be recorded in an orderly fashion so that it can be reviewed when necessary.
A NIST traceable pressure standard measurement reading should accompany each pressure point taken for
comparison purposes.
Keep in mind certain fundamental proceedings when doing these tests.  Purge the pressure line to eliminate
as much air as possible.
Do not allow the top sub connector assembly to be emersed in the oil as it will flood the tool.
Turn on the power supply and frequency counters and allow at least 30 minutes of warm-up time.  After this
initial wait, measurements can begin.

Once the complete data set has been taken, it is to be used to generate coefficients that will be used in third

GENERAL  INFORMATION
The Temperature/RTD Circuits each have five similar components:
Dual power supply (Common Temperature and RTD supply)
Constant current source
Amplifier stage
Voltage-to-Frequency Converter
PCM-counter/interface circuit
The Pressure Circuit has five components:
Dual power supply (Separate from Temperature and RTD supply)
+20 Vdc transducer supply
Amplifier stage
Voltage-to-Frequency converter
PCM-counter/interface circuit
All PCM tools use the 8248 Telemetry Tool to communicate with the surface data acquisition system -
CLS.

TEMPERATURE AND RTD CIRCUITS- Common power supply
The dual power supply for the Temperature and RTD circuits is a stable +23.4 Vdc and +11.7 Vdc
source.
150 Vdc, at the cablehead, is reduced to a regulated +30 Vdc supply and then routed (on PCB 145611)
through resistor R101 to two 11.7 V reference zener diodes, D101 and D102. This establishes a stable
+23.4 Vdc supply.
The junction of the two diodes, a pseudo ground, is the 11.7 Vdc source.  The 23.4 Vdc is 11.7 volts more
positive than this junction, and chassis ground is 11.7 volts below this junction, thus creating a dual
supply.
Filtering is provided across each zener by capacitors C101 and C102.
The output points of 23.4 V, 11.7 V and ground are all made into a bus structure across two terminals so
that multiple wires can be attached and routed to various branch circuitry.
Multiple bus connections are used to reduce the circulating currents between branch circuits making them
less noisy and reducing crosstalk because all current paths are returned directly to the source."
8255XA-TP-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.2 TEMPERATURE CIRCUIT,"TEMPERATURE CIRCUIT
The constant current source/on PCB 145612 consists of U1/pins1-2-3, Q1, R1, R2 & R3.  Precision
resistors R1 and R2 set up a stable reference voltage for U1, which is configured as a voltage follower
with Q1 in its feedback path."

R3 establishes how much current (approx. 1mA) will flow through the temperature sensor which connects
across terminals P1 and P2.
The amplifier stage consists of U1/pins 5-6-7, and its associated resistors.
It amplifies the low level signal that is generated by the probe.
The summing junction (pin 6) controls both the offset and gain of the circuit.
The Voltage-to-Frequency Converter (U2) is a Burr-Brown VFC32 SM.
R11 provides isolation and, working with capacitor C7, U2 gives a full-scale output of 10 KHz for a
10 Vdc input signal.
Capacitor C6 provides a one-shot duration of 8 to 10 Fs.
R12 is a pull-up resistor for the output pulses.
C10, R13, and R14 make up a circuit that restores the pulses back to the chassis ground reference.
The PCM-counter/interface circuitry counts the pulses generated from the sensed temperature and sends
the data to the 8248 Telemetry Tool.
The Remote Unit Controller (RUC- U101 on PCB 145611) is used to count the pulses generated by the
temperature circuit and is the communication link to the telemetry tool.  The Precision Timer (U102 on
PCB 145611) is used in conjunction with the 2 MHz oscillator (U103) to establish an accurate timebase
for the temperature pulses.

RTD (in PRESSURE sensor) CIRCUIT
The constant current source/on PCB 145612 consists of U3/pins1-2-3, Q2, R15, R16 & R17.
Precision resistors R15 and R16 set up a stable reference voltage for U3, which is configured as a voltage
follower with Q2 in its feedback path.
R17 establishes how much current (approx. 0.25 mA) will flow through the RTD sensor, located in the
pressure transducer, which connects across terminals P3 and P4.
The amplifier stage consists of U3/pins 5-6-7, and its associated resistors.
It amplifies the low level signal that is generated by the RTD sensor.
The summing junction (pin 6) controls both the offset and gain of the circuit.
The Voltage-to-Frequency Converter (U4) is a Burr-Brown VFC32 SM.
R28 provides isolation and working with capacitor C15, U4 gives a full-scale output of 10 KHz for a
10 Vdc input signal.
C14 provides a one-shot duration of 8 to 10 Fs.
R26 is a pull-up resistor for the output pulses.

The PCM-counter/interface circuitry counts the pulses generated from the sensed temperature and sends

8255XA-TP-AMO,Circuit Description - 1.4 PRESSURE CIRCUIT,"PRESSURE CIRCUIT
The dual power supply for the Pressure circuit is a stable +23.4 Vdc and +11.7 Vdc source.
150 Vdc, at the cablehead, is reduced to a regulated +30 Vdc supply.
This +30 Vdc, filtered by C1, is routed (on PCB 145612) through resistor R40 to two 11.7 V reference
zener diodes, D1 and D2. This establishes a stable +23.4 Vdc supply.
The junction of the two diodes, a pseudo ground, is the 11.7 Vdc source.
The 23.4 Vdc is 11.7 volts more positive than this junction and chassis ground is 11.7 volts more negative
than this junction, effectively creating a dual supply.
A current imbalance is caused by having a common-source dual supply.  R41 is in parallel with D2 to
reestablish balanced branch currents.
The stable precision +20 Vdc transducer supply originates from the ""30 Vdc"" terminal on INTERFACE
PCB 145611.
A wire is routed from the ""30 Vdc"" terminal to MULTIFUNCTION  PCB 145612 where two cascaded
+10 V regulators, U7 and U8, generate a stable +20 Vdc.
Q3 is used as a pass transistor because U7 & U8 can not deliver sufficient current.
C2 filters the +20 Vdc for the second 10 V regulator-U7.
C3 filters the final +20 Vdc output for the transducer.
This +20 V is the strain gage excitation voltage located at terminals 'A' and 'D'(return) on PCB 145612.
Terminals 'B' and 'C' are the transducer signal outputs and route that signal to
U5/pins 1 & 2.
The amplifier stage magnifies the small signal generated by the pressure transducer.   Instrumentation
amplifier U5 (AD624) is a pin-programmable device configured with a fixed gain of 137.
C18 and C19 help to filter the power supply to U5.
Given a transducer excitation of +20 Vdc and a full-scale output of 50mV, a gain of 137 will equate to
a full-scale amplifier output of 6.85 Vdc - referenced to the +11.7 Vdc pseudo ground.
This amplifier output becomes the input signal to the VFC."

The Voltage-to-Frequency Converter (U6) is a Burr-Brown VFC32 SM.
R30 provides isolation so that U2 gives a full-scale output of 100 kHz for a 10 Vdc input signal.
Amplifier U5 maximum output is 6.85 volts.
There is a fixed offset voltage added to amplifier output to provide an output frequency when there is -
'zero'- ambient pressure.
This offset frequency becomes the ""zero"" or starting point and is created using R37, R38 and R39.  This
design consideration is due to the increasing threshold of the VFC with a temperature increase.
C21 works in conjunction with R30 to yield the final output frequency.
C22 provides a one-shot duration of 3-7 Fs.
R31 is a pull-up resistor for the output pulses.
C24, R32 and R33 make up a network that restores the pulses back to the chassis ground.
The PCM-counter/interface circuitry counts the pulses generated from the sensed pressure and sends
the data to the 8248 Telemetry Tool.
The counter/interface does the counting and the PCM circuitry transmits the data to the 8248 Telemetry
Tool.
The Remote Unit Controller (RUC- U107 on PCB 145611) is used to accumulate the pulses generated
by the pressure circuit and is the communication link to the telemetry tool.
The Precision Timer (U106 on PCB 145611) is used in conjunction with the 2 MHz oscillator U103 to
establish an accurate timebase for the pressure pulses."

 DISASSEMBLY PROCEDURES FOR 1 11/16"" PFC TOOL
The following tools will be required for the disassembly of this tool:
1. Strap wrench (do not use pipe wrench)
2. 7/64 hex wrench 
3. 5/32 hex wrench
4. Small blade screw driver
5. Needle nose pliers
6. Soldering iron
SEE ASSEMBLY DRAWING FOR FOLLOWING PROCEDURES, P/N 158506-000
1. 
Remove CCL assembly with tandem adapter (Items 2 & 6) from PFC tool housing (Item 9) using
strap wrench or comparable wrench (do not use pipe wrench on housing).  To remove coil, magnet
and electronic assembly from CCL, remove both end subs and carefully push internal assembly
from the lower end of the CCL (tandem sub [Item 6] end) out of the CCL housing (Item 7).
2. 
To remove tool assembly from PFC housing (Item 9), use strap wrench and unscrew the bottom sub
(Item 13).  All the internal assembly is attached to the bottom sub.  Carefully slide the assembly out
of the housing onto a suitable work bench for further disassembly.
3. 
Unsolder the shielded cable on the bottom side and  upper end of the Chassis Assembly (Item 16)
and the red, yellow, and black wires from the lower end of the PC board assembly.  Remove the 3
screws attaching the Upper End Header (Item 10) to the Chassis Assembly and carefully pull the
shielded cable through the retainer loops on the Chassis.
4. 
Remove the 3 screws attaching the Heat Shield (Item 18) to the Upper End Header (Item 10).  Keep
some compression against the Upper Header while removing the screws because of the spring
tension from the Spacer Spring (Item 19).  Carefully slide the Heat Shield off the Detector
Assembly (Item 17) and pull the shielded wire through the hole in the Upper Header.  Next remove
the 3 screws attaching the Detector Assembly to the Upper End Header.  At this point you should
have just the Detector Assembly (Item 17) in hand.
SEE DETECTOR ASSEMBLY DRAWING, P/N 158517-000 FOR THE FOLLOWING
5. 
The Detector Assembly must be disassembled very carefully to avoid breaking the Crystal (Item 7)
or the Photomultiplier Tube (Item 5).  First, remove the 3 screws attaching the Top Heat Insulator
(Item 2) to the Detector Housing (Item 8) keeping some compression on this part because of the
Spring (Item 4).  Once these screws are removed the Top Heat Insulator, Spring, and
Photomultiplier Tube Assembly should come out together.  There will be some resistance because
of the ""O"" Rings on the PM Tube Assembly so gently pull on the 3 wires to the PM Tube while
also pulling with the Top Heat Insulator.  If it doesn't want to come out, don't force it.  The Top

Next, to remove the Crystal (Item 7) remove the 6 screws attaching the Detector Housing End Plug
(Item 10) to the Housing and the ""O"" Ring at the lower end of the Crystal.  Carefully slide the
Crystal out of the Housing.  If the Crystal will not slide out, with a soft tipped rod, push from the
upper end to remove it.  Be careful not to damage the Optical Coupler (Item 6) or the face of the
Crystal.  If the Crystal comes out and the Optical Coupler remains in the Housing, use the same
method as above using a soft tipped rod to push it out the bottom end being very careful not damage
it.
7.
Before reassembly begins check all components, PM Tube, Optical Coupler, and Crystal, for any
damage or problems.  If the Crystal is cracked or cloudy it should be replaced.  Clean each item
with denatured alcohol and a lent free tissue and let them dry thoroughly before reassembly into the
Detector Housing.  Reassembly should occur basically in the opposite order of the disassembly."

1114XB,Training Supplement - 1.0 SERVICE OVERVIEW,"SERVICE OVERVIEW
The 1114 XB Minilog is an 1114 XA Minilog that has been adapted to interface
with the Focus tool string.  Like the original design, this Minilog measures the
resistivity adjacent to the wellbore using a pad to primarily read mudcake
resistivity and/or flushed zone resistivity.  Short-spaced pad electrodes measure
laterally about 1.5 inches.  A set of long-spaced pad electrodes measures both
mudcake and formation resistivity up to 4.0 inches away from the pad.  A caliper
curve is recorded simultaneously with the resistivity data, showing mudcake
thickness and washouts.

The series 1114 XB Minilog instrument provides information necessary for
locating and evaluating porous and permeable formations penetrated by the drill
bit.  The pad electrodes are closely spaced, and are placed in contact with the
borehole wall to measure the resistivity of small volumes of formation adjacent to
the borehole.  These small diameter electrodes in a vertical line, spaced one inch
apart, are embedded in the center of an insulated, silicone oil-filled, rubber pad.
The electrode pad and opposing back-up arm are motor driven and operated by
surface commands.  When a log is being made, the pads are extended at the
bottom of the borehole.  Pressure is exerted on the pad to maintain a firm contact
with the borehole wall as the instrument moves toward the surface.

A caliper provides a continuous measurement of borehole variations from 6 to 16
inches, thereby indicating borehole enlargement or the presence of mudcake.
The borehole diameter curve is recorded on a scale calibrated in inches."
1114XB,Training Supplement - 2.0 SERVICE PRINCIPLES,"SERVICE PRINCIPLES

Minilog tools are used to locate porous and permeable zones and to measure
flushed zone resistivity (Rxo).  By measuring voltage and current through the
formation using two different spacings, a resistance can be calculated.  As the
curves are plotted, their behavior can be interpreted to show permeable zones
including the presence of hydrocarbons."
1114XB,Training Supplement - 3.0 THEORY OF OPERATION,"THEORY OF OPERATION

Operation of the Minilog begins with the sensing pad located on an extendable
arm.  This pad, when properly extended, comes in contact with the borehole wall
and signals recovered from its sensing buttons create the log as it is pulled
uphole.  See Figure 1 for a picture of the oil-filled pad and the button
arrangement.  See Figure 2 for a representative log produced from a Minilog

The pad buttons can be used in different configurations (via the setting of relays)
to obtain different measurements.  For standard logging, the 0 button injects a
current into the formation with reference to the backplane (BKP) of the pad.
Button 1 and button 2 tie to the inputs of the detecting circuitry to detect a voltage
that is a “lateral” measurement.  Button 2 with respect to the remote (surface
electrode or bridle) yields a “normal” measurement.  See Table 1 for a list of the
buttons and how they function with relation to the circuitry.  Nomenclature is

with reference to the pad’s backplane.  After traveling through the formation, a
portion of the signal is sensed by other electrodes and it is the voltage present
across a combination of two electrodes that is used to measure the resistance of
the formation and any mud cake that may be present.  The purpose of measuring
this resistance is to determine permeability of the formation.

Minilog tools are capable of detecting laminae less than 1 inch thick if mud cake
is thin and Rmf >> Rw.  A separation between the micronormal and microinverse
traces (resulting from the mud cake) clearly defines permeable intervals and their
boundaries.  Proper mud conditions are necessary in order to use the data
effectively.  The primary use of the data is to segregate porous, permeable strata
from other strata, but it can be used quantitatively to calculate Rxo in fresh mud
conditions."

Fixed resistor values are substituted into the inputs of the detecting circuits to
give a definable value.  For Zero, a 0.50 ohm resistor is used and for Cal, a 150

1114XB,Training Supplement - 5.0 ELECTRICAL OPERATION,"ELECTRICAL OPERATION

This instrument operates on the Focus instrument bus and is powered using the
+28 VDC from this bus.  Current draw is typically 135 milliamps when not
motoring and up to 1 amp when motoring.
Internally, the 1114 XB uses the +28 VDC to power DC to DC converters that
provide power to the digital and analog circuits.  See the circuit description
section of this manual (130973-945) for details on how these circuits operate.
The motor control board 197671-000 interprets commands to extend and retract
the pad and backup arms.  Mechanical limit switches ensure that the range of
travel is kept within limits that prevent physical damage to the mechanical parts.
In an unrestricted, open-air condition, motoring the arms takes approximately 1
minute to open/close.
Current limiting firmware is installed to prevent potential damage to the motor.
Should there be a restriction that prevents the motor from properly closing the
arms causing the current to exceed a set value, power to the motor is interrupted.
Two conditions can occur that will set the firmware into action; they are:
!
If current reaches 1.2 to 1.8 amps, the motor is allowed to operate for 1
more second.  After 1 second, current is interrupted and the motor stops.
!
If current exceeds 1.8 amps at any time, the motor is shut off immediately.
Since this high current condition usually occurs during closing, closing the arms
can continue after restrictions are cleared (if possible).  One method would be to
open the arms and try to close again."

2.0 MINILOG CONTROLLER BOARD
The main function of the Minilog controller board is to measure the driving current,
potential between Button 1 and 2 of the pad, potential between Button 2 and the
Remote from which the normal and lateral curves can be obtained.  In addition, the
Minilog controller board monitors the caliper position and sends the command to
the Motor controller board to extend or retract the caliper arms.
The circuit consists of:
•
on-board power supplies,
•
a Digital Signal Processor (DSP),
•
flash memory,
•
an on-board temperature monitoring IC,
•
Wireline Telemetry System (WTS) communication ICs,
•
an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) to monitor caliper position,
•
driving signal generator,
•
driving signal switching relays,
•
LOG/ZERO/CAL switchers,
•
signal conditioning circuits,
•
3 Channel 16-bit simultaneously sampling ADCs, and
•
interfacing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)

The Minilog circuit is divided into two major portions: Main Controller Block (MCB)
and Minilog Acquisition Block (MAB).  The MCB gets the data from the MAB
through its serial port and performs stacking and DFT on them.  The MAB drives
current into the formation through the buttons on the pad, performs the
measurement and sends the data to MAB.  MCB and MAB are electrically isolated
to eliminate potential grounding loop problems and facilitate the future
development of other tools (e.g. Microlateralog) with the same main controller."

1114XB,Circuit Description - 2.2 MAIN CONTROLLER BLOCK..............................................................................4,"MAIN CONTROLLER BLOCK
Analog Device 32-bit, floating point DSP --- ADSP21061 (U16), is used as the
main processor because of the 16-bit ADC process and availability of the existing
firmware template.  Its program is stored in the flash memory (U41).  During
programming of the flash memory, the write line to the flash memory is delayed
from the write line of DSP through the FPGA to ensure the reliability of
programming, because the address latch mechanism of flash memory makes the
timing critical for the DSP.  The 24 MHz main clock for the DSP is generated from
an oscillator (U7).  A supervisory chip (U24) establishes a positive reset for the
DSP.
The DSP controls an ADC (U6) through its serial port 1 to activate its constant
current source, and switching A/D channel via multiplexer (U5) to measure up to
five caliper or motor positions.
On-board temperature monitoring IC (U14) is controlled by the FPGA (U31)
through the SPI (Serial Port Interface) to send back the temperature reading.
Whenever a new temperature is ready, the FPGA sends an interrupt request so
that the DSP can read back the temperature through the parallel port.
The circuits support Mode 2, Mode 5 and Mode 7 to communicate on the
instrumentation bus.  Mode 2 command input is interrupt-based while Mode 2, 5,
7 output is parallel port DMA-based (Direct Memory Access).  In normal
operation, the Minilog uses only Mode 2 to communicate.
The MCB is isolated from MAB through D25 and D32 - high speed digital
isolators.  The MCB can send 20-bit commands through its serial port 0 and
receive 20-bit status words or continuous 20-bit ADC bit values from SPORT
DMA.
The DSP can send commands to the FPGA through the parallel port and the
FPGA, in turn, transmits the commands through SPI to the isolated Motor
Controller to control the motor (to open or close caliper arms), and return the
motor controller status."

The FPGA (U31) in the Minilog Acquisition Block accepts commands from the
isolated serial port from the DSP, decodes and executes them.  The FPGA
handles the following commands from the DSP:
•
Synthesizer control: FPGA accepts the command and 16-bit control
word and then sends the control word through its own serial port to the
synthesizer (U33).
•
Set the control register: FPGA has a 16-bit control register to set the
MUX attenuator (U9), Relay Control, LOG/CAL/ZERO Control, and ADC

transition of the square wave resulting from the driving signal so that the
ADC starting point of the sinusoidal waveform is always the same.
•

frequency value received from DSP.  This register controls the sampling
rate of the ADC through the sampling clock.

The driving sinusoidal signal is generated from the synthesizer (U8).  The signal
is buffered (U18) to generate the square wave for a consistent sampling starting
point and is passed to the amplifier (U2 B) for a gain of 5.5.  Then it is filtered by a
3-pole low pass filter (U2 A & U2 D) and attenuated by a FPGA controlled
multiplexer (U9).  The driver is voltage feedback amplifier OPA548 T (U10).  The
driving current is measured through a high precision resistor R28.  Relays
controlled by the FPGA and the digital switcher put the current into either Button
0, 1 or a Calibration resistor network."

and U29 pass the RC anti-aliasing filters and are buffered (U27 A & B) before
entering the ADCs (U26 & U34).  The two Dual-Channel, 16-bit ADCs are

3.0 MOTOR CONTROLLER BOARD
The main function of the Motor Controller board is to operate the motor to open or
close the arms.  The motor controller communicates with the main controller
through the isolated SPI bus so that it may be used as a stand-alone unit that can
be used by other pad tools using DC motors.  In an unrestricted, open-air
condition, motoring the arms takes approximately 1 minute to open/close.
Current limiting firmware is installed to prevent potential damage to the motor.
Should there be a restriction that prevents the motor from properly closing the
arms causing the current to exceed a set value, power to the motor is interrupted.
Two conditions can occur that will set the firmware into action; they are:
�
If current reaches 1.2 to 1.8 amps, the motor is allowed to operate for 1
more second.  After 1 second, current is interrupted and the motor stops.
�
If current exceeds 1.8 amps at any time, the motor is shut off immediately.

Since this high current condition usually occurs during closing, closing the arms
can continue after restrictions are cleared (if possible).  One method would be to
open the arms and try to close again."

The motor operates from 28 V DC and the digital circuitry of the controller uses
+5.1 V generated from 28 V DC using Zener D18. 

MICROCONTROLLER
Analog Devices Microcontroller U1 (ADuC812 BS) is used to receive commands
from the main controller through an isolated SPI bus to operate the DC motor.
Signals from the SPI bus are isolated by U11 and are shaped by Schmitt Trigger
device U12.
Power supplied to the motor is made available by control signal POWER ON.
When the main controller wishes to issue a command to operate the motor, it
must also issue a signal to turn power on.  When this signal is high, 28 V power is
not available.  It must go low for isolator chip Q6 to turn on and supply 28 V to the
motor control circuitry.
During operation, the microcontroller continuously monitors the voltage and
current of the motor, the status of 28 VDC, and the status of the two limit
switches.  The main controller can request the values of these monitored
parameters at any time.
•
Motor status for current is obtained via monitoring of current flow through
resistor R22.  Isolation is provided by R23, R24, R25 and R27 to the
inputs of differential amplifier U9.  The output of U9 feeds one of the
inputs (ADC_2) of the microcontroller’s internal A/D converter.
•
Motor status for the transistor collector voltage is obtained via the circuitry
comprised of R15, R16, C14, and D14.  The output of this circuit feeds
another one of the inputs (ADC_1) of the microcontroller’s internal A/D
converter.
•
The status for the 28 V supply is obtained via the circuitry comprised of
C9, R1, R2, C7 and D13.  The output of this circuit feeds another one of
the inputs (ADC_0) of the microcontroller’s internal A/D converter.
•
Detecting whether the top limit switch is open/closed is sensed by the
input of ADC_3 and the circuitry of R4, R7, R9 and C10.
•
Detecting whether the bottom limit switch is open/closed is sensed by the
input of ADC_4 and the circuitry of R5, R8, R10 and C11.

APPENDIX A: DC POWER SUPPLIES 8

MOTOR CONTROL AND LIMIT SWITCHES
Isolated MOSFET switches Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are controlled by the Micro-
controller U1 to control the direction of the motor.  When Q1 and Q4 are turned
on, the current will flow from MOT+ to MOT–, and conversely, when Q2 and Q3
are turned on, the current will flow from MOT– to MOT+.
The current of the motor is controlled by DAC_0 of microcontroller through
voltage follower U10 and transistor Q5 (BDP949).  When the microcontroller
receives the command to operate the motor, it will ramp up the voltage of its
DAC_0 slowly to control the current flowing through the motor to prevent a
voltage spike.  When the current reaches the required stable condition, DAC_0
keeps the same voltage output.  When the microcontroller receives the command
to stop motoring, it reduces the voltage so that the current of the motor will be
ramped down to prevent arcing.  In addition, the microcontroller will automatically
turn off the motor in the situation when there is very high current surge or
consistent high current in the motor.
The limit switches prevent the motor from never operating outside the range of a
specific physical distance.  The limit switches are in normally closed position and
open only when activated during operation.  As a result, +5 V power is interrupted
to Q1/or Q2 and will be turned off even though the microcontroller tries to turn
them on.  The motor will be stopped and can only operate in the reverse
direction.  Diodes D4 and D5 prevent voltage spikes or arcing when opening a
limit switch.  They provide the path to discharge the current in the motor.

APPENDIX A: DC POWER SUPPLIES
The 1114 XB Minilog has two power supplies mounted on the electronics
backbone.  Along with one of the supplies is an EMI filter module to drastically
reduce interference and interaction between supplies of other Matrix instruments.
These self-contained, modular supplies mount on a heat-sinking channel and have
additional circuitry mounted on a PC board that is soldered directly to the pins of
the supply.  It is this additional circuitry that will be the topic of discussion for this
section.
Because the power supplies are modular, there is no repair of the unit.  It either
works or it doesn’t.  The only circuitry external to the module (U1) is some
inhibiting control and some additional output filtering.

+5 V Single Power Supply
See the schematic below for a typical configuration of these external components
for a single output power module.


Instrument power is defined as +28 volts for the Focus tool string.  This instrument
power first passes through an EMI filter module before being applied to a DC to
DC converter module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a filtered +28 V.  E2 is tied
to the return line of the EMI filter output.  Pins 6, 7 and 8 are tied to chassis ground
which, in turn, is tied to cable armor.  Two independent windings of a choke, L1,
filter voltage spikes on the output of the converter module.  Provision is made at J1
for trimming the output voltage under expected loads.  In most cases, this
provision is left unused.  Additional output filtering is provided by capacitors C3, C4

Dual 5 V Power Supply
In the case where a power supply module generates an output of dual polarity, the
associated circuitry is slightly modified.  See the schematic below.


Again, instrument power first passes through an EMI filter module before being
applied to any DC to DC converter module; thus, the voltage at terminal E1 is a
filtered +28 V.  E2 is tied to the return line of the EMI filter output.  Pins 6, 7 and 8
are tied to chassis ground, which is tied to cable armor.  Three independent
windings of a choke, L1, filter voltage spikes on the output of the module.  No
provision is made for trimming the output voltage.  Additional output filtering is
provided by capacitors C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7.

Power Control Circuit
Associated with at least one of the DC to DC power supply modules is an EMI filter
module.  The PC board attached to this module performs several control functions.
These control functions are described below.
A +5 volt supply is generated for other chips on the PC board.  The supply
consists of a single dropping resistor (R3) and reference Zener diode (D1) to
establish the voltage.  This supply is connected to the output of the EMI filter
module (U1).  It is this +28 V EMI filter output that connects to the input of other DC
to DC converter modules within the instrument.  See the schematic below.


heart of the power control circuitry is a programmable microcontroller (U3).  Values
for resistor R7 and capacitor C3 have been selected to give an operating
frequency of approximately 1 MHz.  Supplied with +5 volts from the supply of
(1) A threshold voltage is established using chip U4.  The voltage divider
consisting of R6 and R8 are chosen such that when 20 volts or more (for
instrument power) is present on R6, the reset chip removes the LOW on pin 7
which in turn removes the reset from the microcontroller, U3, allowing it to do
its job.
(2) Jumper inputs to the microcontroller chip, U3, set different length delay
times.  Delay times are established for different tools to limit the current
demand when the Focus tool sting is first powered up.  Delay times, in
milliseconds, and their jumpers are shown in the table below.

(3) When power is first applied to the microcontroller, output RA1 of U3 pin 18
is floating (open collector circuit).  Resistor R4 pulls the base of Q1 HIGH
turning it ON.  This state applies a ground potential to all power supplies tied to
the Q1 collector.  Diodes (D2 – D4) form an OR function in the collector circuit,
allowing control over different power supplies.  By tying the INHIBIT pin (active
low) of each DC-to-DC converter module within an instrument to one of these
control terminals (E5, E6 or E7), you can independently control its ON/OFF
function.  With Q1 initially turned ON, no power supply module can turn ON.  It
is not until the time-out function is completed by U3 that output RA1 can
transition LOW, turning OFF Q1.  With Q1 turned OFF, power supplies are
allowed to turn ON because their INHIBIT is removed.  As the power supplies
turn ON, their current demand is confined to that particular instrument.  Again,

Refer to drawing 198384-100 for the complete schematic of the Power
Controller board.  As an added feature of this circuit, Power Supply #2 or
Power Supply #3 can be turned OFF by an external source via opto-isolator
U2.  Terminal E8 is tied to a positive voltage.  Taking control terminal E9 or
E10 LOW causes its respective switch to close.  This applies a ground potential
to the INHIBIT input of the supply that is tied to its control terminal, E6 or E7.
This LOW turns OFF the respective power supply.  Terminal E9 controls a
power supply (P.S.2) connected to terminal E6, while E10 controls a supply
(P.S.3) connected to terminal E7.  Thus, independent control is available if
needed.  Power supplies connected to E5 are solely controlled by the timing
function associated with the operation of transistor Q1.  See the schematic
below."
1114XB,Circuit Description - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"The 1114 XB Minilog Instrument is comprised of DC power supplies and two main
PC boards; one for motor control and the other for all other functions.  This pad-
type tool, when in contact with wellbore surfaces, transmits a 488 KHz sine wave
into the formation via a button that is mounted on the pad.  Receiver buttons
mounted on the same pad in close proximity to the transmitter button detect this
waveform after its interaction with the surrounding formations.  These signals are
phase-detected, amplified, filtered, processed, and sent to the surface computer
system by the circuitry in the electronics section.  A caliper circuit senses the
position of the pad and backup arm, when extended, by a 5 K potentiometer.

The complete 1239 DLL-S Electronics, mandrel, Iso-sub, and a system tester along with appropriate
telemetry tool(s), 3506 PCM or 3516 PCM/3510 WTS common remote should be connected to the
CLS/Eclipse computer via at least 15,000 feet of line. This allows proper checkouts of the complete
system for the 1239 EA/MA DLL-S surface hardware configuration.
The Procedure used to Switch DLL-S to Standard/Groningen return modes depends on the
Computerized logging system in use and the makeup of the tool string (3506 or 3516 PCM )."

ELECTRONICS LOG CHECKOUT
In this section, the electronics will be checked for proper response to a wide range of formation
resistivities by using the Electronics Test Box and wiring Harness.  The electronics should be
connected to a surface computer system, ECLIPS or CLS, through a patch box and 3506 or 3516
telemetry.  See Figure  951-1   Electronics Test Hookup for proper setup.

1.3.1
Instrument Mode Selection
Switch the Shallow circuit to the desired Standard or Enhanced mode.  Power up the
electronics and place the deep circuit in the desired Standard Wireline or Groningen current
return mode.  The Procedure used to Switch DLL-S to Standard/Groningen return modes
depends on the Computerized logging system in use and the makeup of the tool string (3506
or 3516 PCM ).  If the instrument is to be checked out for the Groningen operating mode, a
banana plug must be placed between the #10 and #9 jack on the Test Box.
1.3.2
Initial Box Setting
Switch the toggle switch on the Test Box to ""ELEC"" and place the Rm switch to 0.1 ohmm
position.  Place the Rf switch to .2 and the GUARD switch to .2 on the "".1 GUARD side""."

Internal Signal Check
Calibrate the instrument using nominal Engineering values of 10, 10 K for both deep and
shallow.  Check the Table below for proper output levels of the internal CAL/ZERO signals.
These values are dependant on which mode the deep and shallow circuits have been placed

The resistivity value of the uninvaded formation, Rt, is
critical for calculation of water saturation.  In a highly
conductive borehole and high resistivity formations,
galvanic tools consisting of an array of both current
injecting and voltage measuring electrodes, like the Rt
Explorer (RTeX), are the preferred instruments.
The complete Focus RTeX system consists of not only
the RTex electrode mandrel, but also the housings of
other instruments above and below.  The RTeX mandrel
contains the electrodes (center electrode and guards)
needed for the measurement of the shallowest resistivity
(MLR1) and two intermediate diameters of investigation
(MLR2 and MLR3).
Observe the instrument sketch on the right.  The guard
electrodes are symmetrical around the center electrode
A0, with M1, M2, A1, A2 and A3 situated on the mandrel
itself.  This system can be thought of as an array of four
laterologs, LL7 type, with increasing guard length from
shallow to deep.
The instruments immediately above and below the RTeX
mandrel (typically Acoustilog or Densilog above and
Focus Micro-laterolog below) become electrode A4 and
provide the guards for the deeper diameter-of-
investigation resistivity measurement.  On the uphole side

of the upper A4 electrode housing, and on the downhole side of the lower A4
electrode housing, Isolation Subs are installed to limit the A4 electrode size.
These Isolation Subs also separate the electrode A5 (upper and lower) from A4
and provide a means for the RTeX electronics to make connection to the A5
electrode.  The particular Isolation Sub used (FOCUS or WTS) depends on the
tool string being configured.
All electrodes on the RTeX mandrel are symmetrical around the center electrode
(A0) in number and size.  Each of the two A4, upper and lower, electrodes is
required to be 10 to 14 ft in length.  However, the upper A5 and lower A5 can be
quite different in length.
Additionally, electrodes A2 and A3 are bookended by small voltage-sense
electrodes.  The A1 electrode has one sense electrode (on the A2 electrode
side).
The Rt Explorer housing is isolated with a layer of fiberglass and the electrodes
are placed on top of this layer.  The isolation between electrodes is a ring of
rubber at each electrode end and more fiberglass in between.
Electronic circuitry for the system is located inside the RTeX mandrel.
Housing material is titanium to reduce the overall weight and allows the
instrument to be handled by a smaller logging crew.
In summary:
•
RTeX provides four apparent resistivity curves with different diameters of
investigation (approximately 18”, 26”, 38” and 74”).
•
It is a fully compatible Focus tool.
•
Environmental corrections can be applied to the apparent resistivity curves.
•
The measured data can be inverted in real-time to derive formation resistivity Rt,

1241XA-RTEX-AMO,Brief Description of Service .................................................. - 1.2 PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION..............................................................................4,"PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION

To illustrate the principle of operation of the Rt Explorer (RTeX), a block diagram
of the electrode array and interface electronics is shown in Figure 1.  Only half of
the array is shown in the block diagram.  Please remember that for each one of
the electrodes shown, i.e. M1, M2, A1 - A5, there is a corresponding M1’, M2’,
A1’ - A5’ electrode.
Electrodes A0, M1, M2, A1, A2, and A3, are located on the RTeX mandrel.  The
instruments above and below the mandrel become part of the electrode system
and are referred to as electrodes A4 and A5.
Four sinusoidal sources, each at different frequencies ranging from 30 to 195 Hz,
are connected as indicated in the diagram.  Frequencies F1, F2, and F3 are
voltage sources and F4 is a current source.
A0 is the current measuring electrode.  The bucker amplifier injects sufficient
current through A0 into the formation to maintain the difference in potential
between M1 and M2 at zero for all four frequencies.  This prevents the I0 current
from flowing up or down the borehole, but rather is forced into the formation in a
“disk” shape, perpendicular to the instrument.  The voltage across the sensing
resistor is proportional to the I0 current.
Electrodes A1, A2, A3 and A4 provide guards of increasing length to electrode
A0.  At frequency F1 the guard is only A1; return for F1 is A2, A3 and A4.  At
frequency F2 the effective guard has increased in length, and is the combination
of A1 and A2 which focuses the frequency F2 currents deeper than the F1
currents.  Return for this mode is A3 and A4.  This pattern continues and the
guard for frequency F3 is the combined length of the A1, A2 and A3 electrodes
with the return being only A4.  Finally for frequency F4, the guard is A1, A2, A3
and A4 (with return being A5), providing the deepest measurement.  All four of
these frequencies are being emitted simultaneously to create the varying
diameters of investigation and are illustrated in Figure 2.
The voltage of electrode M1 combined with the current I0, both measured at the
four operating frequencies F1, F2, F3 and F4, provide the resistance seen by A0
under the respective focusing conditions and with increased diameter-of-
investigation from shallow to deep.  By applying the proper “k” factors, these
resistances are converted to resistivities at four diameters of investigation.
Normally a Micro-resistivity instrument, like MLL, is connected below the RTeX
and becomes the lower A4 electrode guard.  The MLL provides an Rxo measure-
ment that is used for RTeX data processing and inversion.

1241XA-RTEX-AMO,Brief Description of Service .................................................. - 1.3 DATA ACQUISITION ...........................................................................................7,"DATA ACQUISITION
The 1241 XA Rt Explorer (RTeX) is a galvanic resistivity tool with four diameters
of investigation.  Two measurements are required to determine resistivity: VM
and I0.  VM is a measurement of the voltage of the M1 electrode with respect to
surface remote, and I0 is the survey current entering/leaving electrode A0.  Both
signals are sampled by A/D’s on the preamp board and processed by the Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) on the Controller board.  If the tool only had to provide a
measurement for one diameter of investigation, there would be only one driver
operating at one frequency, and the resistivity could be determined simply by
examining the amplitudes of VM and I0.  However with four drivers operating at
different frequencies, the VM and I0 signals will each be a composite waveform
of four different sinusoids.  Now we can no longer just examine the amplitude of
the time-domain waveform.  Each waveform must first be decomposed into their
four constituent components.  The “decomposition” is done by performing a
Discrete-Fourier Transform (DFT) on the signals.  The DFT process provides the
amplitude and phase of the sinusoids comprising each waveform.  This
processing is performed downhole by the DSP, and the results are reported to
the surface for resistivity calculations.

The A/D sampling frequency is ~7.653kHz and the DFT is performed on sets of
512 samples.  To avoid spectral leakage, the four operating frequencies are
chosen to be integer multiples of a base frequency, 14.947 Hz.  These are
29.89 Hz (F4), 104.6 Hz (F1), 164.4 Hz (F3) and, 194.3 Hz (F2).  The operating
frequencies and A/D sampling frequency are derived from a common system
clock so they are precisely related to each other.

The DFT results from multiple cycles are stacked (or added) together.  The
stacked DFT results along with a stack count are reported in the subsets.  The
stack count indicates how many cycles were stacked in the DFT result.  An
averaged DFT result is determined by dividing the stacked results by the stack
count.  Typically, the time interval between “Acquire Subset” commands
determines how many cycles are stacked.  One cycle is 66.9ms (512 A/D
samples).  When the tool receives an “Acquire” command, it (1) waits for the
current cycle to complete, (2) transfers the contents of the stacking buffer to a
send buffer, and (3) clears the stacking buffer to start a new stack.  The “Send
subset” command starts transmission of data to the surface from the send buffer.
The default maximum stacking level is 60.  If the maximum stacking level is
reached, the stacking buffer will be transferred to the send buffer and a new
stack will be started.

In addition to the frequency-domain data (DFT results), the underlying time-
domain waveforms are stacked as well.  The full waveforms, each being 512
samples long, can be uploaded in Subset 4.  The waveforms are made available
for debugging purposes only, that is, they are not needed for processing.

Only VM and I0 are needed to determine resistivity, but the voltage and current
of each driver are measured as well for control purposes.  The DSP implements
a control algorithm used to determine the optimum driver output levels.  The goal
of the algorithm is to operate the drivers at the highest achievable drive level
8

under varying borehole conditions.  Another goal of the algorithm is to maintain a
reasonable balance in the magnitude spectrum of the I0 signal so that one
spectral component does not over-power the measurement and compromise the
measurement of the other components.

The control algorithm periodically checks the measurements to see if they are all
within range.  If any waveform exceeds a high or low limit, the control algorithm
will incrementally decreases the driver output levels until all waveforms fall within
range.  VM and I0 are monitored to see if the signal levels are within the
measurement circuit’s input range.  The output current of the voltage sources are
monitored to ensure they are within design limits.  The output voltages of all the
power opamps are monitored to ensure their outputs are not clipping.

On power-up, the algorithm initializes all drive levels to a default value.
Afterwards, it examines I0 and determines the relative drive settings needed to
equalize the magnitudes of the four spectral components.  After determining the
relative drive settings, the algorithm searches for the maximum achievable drive
levels by incrementally increasing them until an out-of-range condition occurs on
any waveform.  Afterwards, the drive levels are reduced to bring all signals back
within range.  After finding the optimum drive levels, the control algorithm saves
the state of I0 for future comparison.  The algorithm may decide to search for a
new drive setting if a significant change occurs on I0.

The main operational subset is Subset 2.  This subset contains the frequency-
domain data for I0 and VM, which is needed to determine resistivity.  Additional
waveform data is reported as well for monitoring purposes.  Waveform data for
I0, VM, and the driver voltages and currents are reported.  In an effort to maintain
a reasonable subset size, only one waveform at a time is sent.  Each acquisition
sends a different waveform.  A wave ID parameter is included in the subset to
indicate which waveform was sent.  To further reduce the length of the subset,
the waveform is decimated to 128 samples."

The shallowest diameter-of-investigation is ~ 18 inches, that distance makes the
curve MLR1 sensitive to borehole ruggosity; to improve the response of the tool it
is recommended to centralize the tool for small borehole sizes.  But for big
borehole sizes this curve is going to read mainly mud even when the tool is
centralized.  For that reason, for boreholes greater than 8.5”, it is better to run the
tool with 1.5 inch Stand-Offs.  Do not run the tool FREE.

For the RTeX, the main purpose is to provide the description of the variation of
resistivity in invaded zones in salt saturated borehole fluids.
The RTeX interpretation uses the Rxo provided by the MLL in conjunction with
the four RTeX resistivities (MLR1, MLR2, MLR3, and MLR4) to produce a
corrected Rt and the length-of-invasion Lxo.

RTeX DELIVERABLES
Well site deliverables are the four apparent resistivities MLR1, MLR2, MLR3, and
MLR4 borehole corrected.  In addition to the normal environmental corrections
(through ENCOR program) a more advanced correction mechanism is available
for RTeX measurements.  The ABC (Adaptive Borehole Correction) processing
accounts for the tool position within the borehole beyond the two supposed
positions, centered and eccentered, that are available through ENCOR. The ABC
more properly corrects the curves for borehole effects and does not suffer from
the problem of over or under correcting that would be inherent in simple borehole
correction.  Additionally, the ABC utilizes data from all four curves simultaneously
and results inversion provides estimations of Rxo, Lxo, Rt and the tool
eccentricity within the borehole.  Normally MLL will be run in combination.  In this
case the MLL apparent resistivity will complement the four RTeX readings.
Please see RTeX log example in Figure 3.
The four MLR curves were designed to provide a clear indication of invasion.  To
accomplish this, diameter-of-investigation from very shallow (MLR1 ~ 18 inches)
to fairly deep (MLR4 ~ 74 inches) are required.  MLR1 is in particular helpful in
defining the invasion of relatively low resistivity encountered in a formation with
an oil-water contact.
These values of diameter-of-investigation are not fixed like we are accustomed to
seeing with induction resistivity instruments, but they change markedly with the
change in contrast between the resistivity of the formation and the borehole fluid.
Diameters-of-investigation for lateral tools are not fixed as they are for induction
type measurements, but are highly dependent on the contrast between the
formation resistivity and that of the resistivity of borehole fluid.  The diameter-of-
investigation becomes shallower as the contrast Rt/Rm increases.
The borehole correction also increases with the contrast Rt/Rm.  Furthermore,
borehole correction becomes greater as the instrument deviates from being
perfectly centered in the borehole.
RTeX borehole corrections are computed for two situations: (1) centered where
the tool is exactly in the center of the borehole, and (2) eccentered with 1.5”
standoff where the tool is on one side of the borehole wall and would be touching
the wall except for the standoffs.  The logs with centered tools would require less
correction than the eccentered ones for the same borehole size and Rt/Rm.
For large boreholes (12 ¼” bit size) and high contrast, the MLR1 borehole
correction becomes excessively large.  The uncertainty of the position of the

instrument, as well as the departure from the borehole being a cylinder of
constant diameter over the length of the instrument, precludes an accurate
correction.
For these reasons, MLR1 is displayed only when the borehole correction is such
that it preserves the accuracy of the final result.

Before the +28 volts is applied to a power supply module, it passes through a
special circuit used to filter noise from other instruments hanging on this common
power source.  It is the output of these filters that is applied as an input to the
power supplies.  For more detail, see section 2.6.3 of this document.
This filtered +28 volts is reduced to ±5 volts using a DC-to-DC converter module
A3000558000.  This voltage source provides power wherever a bipolar 5 V

2.2.1 TELEMETRY COMMUNICATIONS

The 1241 XA Rt Explorer uses the Focus Telemetry protocol for
communication on the instrument bus.  It adheres to the specification
F198157000.

U9 is an Actel FPGA which contains a Manchester Decoder for decoding
commands on the instrument bus, and two Manchester Encoders.  One
encoder is dedicated for mode 2 data, and the other for modes 5 or 7.
The FPGA also provides an interface to the temperature sensor and
serial EEPROM.  All internal registers are selected with /MS3.  The
receiver (U12) for mode 2 commands and drivers (U10, U11, U14) for
mode 2, 5, and 7 are shown on sheet 4.  The instrument bus transformers
are located on a separate PC board (A3000773000).

Data transfer between the DSP and mode 2 encoder/decoder is interrupt-
driven using IRQ1.  Interrupt line IRQ1 is shared between the mode 2
decoder and mode 2 encoder.  A status register within the FPGA
indicates the source of the interrupt.  This register is read by the DSP to
determine which device generated the interrupt.  The decoder asserts
IRQ1 whenever it receives a command that is addressed to the tool.  The
interrupt notifies the DSP to read the command from the receive buffer
within the FPGA.  The mode 2 encoder can also be enabled to generate
an interrupt using /IRQ1.  When the DSP is ready to send data on mode
2, the encoder interrupt is enabled.  Once enabled, the encoder asserts
/IRQ1 whenever the transmit buffer is empty and ready to accept new
data.  The DSP writes a new word to the encoder in response to the
interrupt.  Figure 3 shows the tool receiving a “Send Subset E” command
and responding on Mode 2.

AUG 2009
Baker Atlas
A second encoder is used to transmit data on either mode 5 or mode 7.
Writes to this encoder is DMA driven using /DMAR2 and /DMAG2.  The
DMA request line (/DMAR2) is asserted by the FPGA when the encoder
is ready to accept new data.  In response, the DSP asserts /DMAG2 and
presents data on the bus (D[31:16]).  The data is latched in the encoder
transmit buffer on the rising edge of /DMAG2.  Bus control signals /MS1
and /WR are not active during the DMA transfer.  Figure 4 shows the tool
transmitting Subset E on Mode 5.  The bottom half of the capture is a
zoomed-in view of the first DMA transaction.  A second transaction
closely follows because the transmit buffer becomes ready immediately
after the encoder latches the data and begins transmitting.  Subsequent
transactions are spaced 171µs apart.  The last pulse may or may not be
present, depending on whether or not the DSP responds to an internal
DMA interrupt in time to disable the DMA before the last word has been
latched by the encoder.
2.2.2 DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR

U4 is an Analog Devices digital-signal processor (DSP).  Instruction code
for the device is stored in Flash memory (U5).  The DSP features 4 Mbits
of internal memory for storage of program and data.  After a power-on, or
software reset, the code is loaded from flash into internal memory.

The DSP can be booted from either the upper or lower half of flash
memory.  By default, the DSP boots from the upper half since the boards
are shipped without JP1 installed.  If JP1 is installed, the DSP will boot
from the lower half.  If necessary, new firmware updates can be

downloaded using Benchmark software (A7000205 SW).  Updating the
firmware requires that the DSP re-program the flash memory.  If a
problem occurs during the download process and corrupts the boot
memory, the DSP can be re-booted from the backup copy in the lower
half of flash memory.

Much of the interfacing between the DSP and peripheral devices is done
through two Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), U9 and U16.  U16
is an Actel FPGA which contains the logic to interface with the drivers and
A/D’s.  U9 contains the interface for the instrument bus, serial EPROM,
and temperature sensor.

A heartbeat LED (D6) blinks once every second.  This LED is a useful
tool to help determine if the DSP is operating correctly.

Header P3 is a connector for an in-circuit emulator and used for
development purposes only.
2.2.3 DATA ACQUISITION

The output voltage and output current of each driver, as well as the output
voltage of the Bucker board, are measured and gathered as data in the
overall scheme of this instrument.  The chore of gathering the data and
sending it to the surface is one of the functions of the DSP.  Measurement
circuits are found on sheets 10 and 11.  Sheet 10 contains the four A/D
channels used to measure the output current of each driver.  Sheet 11
contains five A/D channels to the output voltage of the four drivers and
the bucker.

The following description starts at the top-right corner of sheet 10 to trace
the signal path of the mode 1 driver’s current measurement.  U38 is an
instrumentation amplifier used to measure the differential voltage across
a current sense resistor mounted on the chassis.  R177 sets the gain at
5 V/V.  Input over-voltage protection is provided by R175 and R176 and
clamping diodes D16.  After the instrumentation amplifier, the signal is
level-shifted and lightly filtered by opamp U123.  A 1.25 V offset is added
to center the signal within the 2.5 V input range of the A/D converter.  U55
is a 16-bit A/D converter.

Other A/D channels are similar to the previously described channel.
However, there are some differences in the first stage.  The mode 1, 2,
and 3 driver voltages are measured without the aid of an instrument
amplifier.

The reference voltage for the analog section is provided by U36.  It
generates a 2.5 V reference voltage.  A voltage divider (R147 and R156)
is used to derive a 1.25 V reference needed by the DDS chips.  U121 A
buffers the 2.5 V reference to provide a low impedance reference for the

A/D’s.  A 625mV reference is also generated to bias the non-inverting
input of the opamp in each channel.

An A/D conversion is initiated by a rising edge on the CNV input (pin 6).
The CNV input of all the A/D’s are driven by the A/D sampling clock
(/MLL_AD_CLK) which is generated by FPGA U16.  The A/D sampling
clock is an inverted pulse generated every 130.7µs.  The A/D’s have a
serial interface consisting of a serial clock (SCK), serial data out (SDO),
and serial data in (SDI).  The A/D’s are daisy-chained by connecting the
SDO of one device to the SDI of another.  This configuration allows U16
to read all A/D’s, using only one data line, in one long serial bit stream.
FPGA U16 drives SCK and shifts in data from the SDO of U79.  SCK is a
discontinuous clock operating at 12 MHz.

The A/D timing is illustrated below in Figure 5.  After the FPGA pulses
/MLL_AD_CLK to initiate a conversion, it waits 4.6µs after the rising edge
to allow the A/D’s to finish the conversion.  After waiting for the
conversion to complete, the FPGA drives SCK for 160 cycles to shift out
the new A/D data.

The most involving task of the FPGA (U16) is to collect the A/D samples
and deliver them to the DSP.  Data from the A/D’s located on the
Controller board, as well as the A/D data from the Preamp board, are
collected and written to a FIFO for the DSP to read.  A block diagram of

FPGA.  The DMA (direct memory access) controller allows data to be
read from the FPGA without the direct involvement of the core processor,
freeing it to do more meaningful work.  DMA transfers occur through the
use of two handshaking signals: /DMAR1 (dma request) and /DMAG1
(dma grant).  The FPGA asserts /DMAR1 whenever there is data
available in the FIFO.  In response, the DSP asserts /DMAG1 while
reading one word from the FIFO in the FPGA.  Although the data bus
(D[31:16]) is used to transfer data, the memory-select (/MS2) and read
(/RD) signals are not active during the DMA read operation.  See diagram
of Figure 7.

The FIFO is 16 bits wide.  Each A/D sample generates two writes to the
FIFO – one for the most-significant word and one for the least significant
word.  For the case of the 16-bit onboard A/D’s, the most-significant word
is 0000h.  For the 18-bit A/D’s on the Preamp, the most-significant word
includes the upper two bits of the A/D value; unused bit positions are
zero-filled.
clock (point A).  After waiting 4.6μs, the FPGA starts shifting in data from
the onboard A/D’s (point B).  Shortly thereafter, the Preamp starts
sending A/D data as well (point C).  The FPGA latches each Preamp
word on the rising edge of RFS and immediately writes the word into the
FIFO.  A DMA request occurs as a result of each FIFO write operation
(point D).
The data collected from the onboard A/D’s is not written into the FIFO
until the following sampling clock.  After shifting in the serial data, the
FPGA holds the data in the shift-register until the falling edge of the next
sampling clock.  The DMA requests resulting from the FIFO write
operations can be seen at point E.


The FPGA counts the number of words returned by the Preamp board.  If
the FPGA does not receive enough data from the Preamp board by the
end of the cycle, it will write zeroes into the FIFO in lieu of the missing
words.  On the other hand, if it receives too many words, it will inhibit
writing the extra words into the FIFO.  These measures are taken to
ensure the coherency of the data.  The DSP expects a certain number of
words each cycle.  Missing or extra words will cause the processing to

2.2.4 ELECTRODE DRIVERS

Reference Signals
Four identical circuits are used to create a sinusoidal reference signal for
each driver.  These circuits can be found on the top half of sheets 6, 7, 8,
and 9.  These circuits are physically identical to each other but they each
generate a different frequency.  Refer to page 6 of the schematic for the
following discussion of the reference signal generated for the mode 1
driver.
The signal chain begins with U21 which is a DDS chip used to generate a
105 Hz sine wave.  The frequency and phase of the sine wave is
programmed by the DSP during startup.  Pin 14 is the sine wave output.
The waveform at this point is unipolar, ranging from 0 to approximately
800mV.
This unipolar sine wave is ac-coupled by C311 and R245 to remove the
DC offset and create a bipolar waveform.  U102 A buffers the signal.
U102 B and its surrounding components form a 2nd order low-pass filter
needed to remove quantization noise.  The signal at TP59 is a clean sine
wave, centered at 0 V, with an amplitude of 400mV.  Afterwards, the
signal passes through a programmable attenuator.
The programmable attenuator is formed by multiplexer U25 and
surrounding resistors.  R72 is the bottom resistor of a voltage divider, and
the top resistor is selectable through U25.  The 8-to-1 mux allows for 8
levels of attenuation ranging from 1/1 to 1/128.  The attenuation settings
were chosen so that they vary by a factor of 2.  U102 C buffers the signal
after the attenuation stage.  Afterwards, the signal is ac-coupled with
C334 and R235 to remove any DC offset that may be added by the
previous stages.  U102 D buffers the signal again to drive transformer T5.
U101 is a comparator used to detect the zero crossing point of the
reference signal.  The comparator output feeds back into an FPGA (U16),
which waits for a rising edge on SQUARE_WAVE_F1 before updating the
mux enable (MUX_EN_F1) or mux select signals (MUX_A2_F1,
MUX_A1_F1, MUX_A0_F1).  This feature is included to minimize abrupt
changes in the reference signal when switching attenuation settings.  A
simplified sketch of the logic is shown below in Figure 9.  The DSP writes
the attenuation setting to a control register, but the new settings do not
take effect until a rising edge occurs at the comparator output.  A light RC

the DDS chips.  The SPORT1 I/O signals consist of TCLK1, TFS1, DT1,
RFS1, and DR1.  These signals connect to the FPGA.  Although
connected, RFS1 and DR1 are not used - they are held high by the
FPGA.  The FPGA passes serial clock (TCLK1) and data (DT1) through
to the DDS chips on TCLK_SYN and DT_SYN, respectively.  The frame
sync (TFS1) is gated to allow the DSP to selectively write to the DDS
chips.  The DSP enables the individual DDS frame sync lines through a
memory-mapped control register.  The logic is illustrated in Figure 10.

discussion describes the operation of the mode 1 driver circuit shown on
page 6.  The other drivers on pages 7 and 8 operate in a similar manner.
The output transformer and current sense resistor for the driver are
mounted on the chassis.  A simplified schematic of the entire driver is
shown in Figure 11 below.  The function of the circuit is to impose a
reference signal, presented on the primary winding of T5, across the A2*
and A1* sense electrodes.  The sense electrodes can be thought of as
remote sense terminals that allow the voltage directly at the “load” to be
regulated.  The “load” in this case is the mud (or borehole fluid), which is
driven by electrodes A2 and A1.  Rather than sensing directly at the drive
electrodes, where IR drops and contact impedances can affect the
regulation, separate sense electrodes are used instead.  The sense
electrodes are located close to their respective drive electrodes on the
housing.

separate the discussion into an AC analysis and DC analysis.  For AC
analysis, capacitors C331 and C337 are considered to be shorts and
resistors R294 and R295 are neglected because their impedance is much
greater than the impedance of the capacitors.  For DC analysis, the
capacitors are open and the effects of the resistors are considered.  At
0.159 Hz, the impedance of the capacitors equals the impedance of the
resistors.  At frequencies above 0.159 Hz, the effects of the capacitors
dominate and the resistors can be ignored.  This is especially true at the
four operating frequency of the drivers (30 Hz, 105 Hz, 165 Hz, and
195 Hz.), which is much greater than 0.159 Hz.

T5 is a 1:1 transformer that is used to translate the reference signal,
which is referenced to ground, into a floating source that can be used to
drive the (+) input of U31 with respect to the A1* sense.  Because of
negative feedback, the opamp adjusts its output to whatever voltage
necessary to make the voltage at the (-) input equal to that of the (+)

input.  A 6:1 step-down transformer (TF1) is used to couple the output to
the electrodes.  TF1 boosts the output current, which reduces the amount
of current that needs to be supplied by U31 and the power supplies.  R3
is a resistor used for measuring the driver’s output current.

Resistors R294 and R295 are needed to provide DC feedback for the
opamp.  These resistors provide a path for input bias currents and
establish the DC operating point of the opamp.  The opamp needs to be
biased so that its output rests at 0 V.  The DC offset at the output of the
opamp needs to be controlled because the transformer winding presents
a low resistance DC path to ground.

Before proceeding any farther, it should be mentioned that the driver
looks at the average voltage of the sense electrodes.  For the sake of
simplicity, the circuit illustrated in Figure 11 only presents the upper
electrode array.  Rather than just looking at A2*, the positive sense is
taken to be the average voltage of the A2* and A2’* electrode.  The
averaging is performed by R221 and R223.  These resistors can be found
on sheet 2 of the schematic.  Similarly, the negative sense is taken to be
the average of the A1* and A1’* electrode voltages.  This averaging is
performed by R222 and R224.

Again on sheet 6, U31 is a power opamp capable of driving high currents.
The output current limit is set by R94.  With 15.4kΩ for R94, the current
limit is set at 750mA.  An enable pin (pin 8) is provided to allow the
opamp to be disabled --- this places the output in a high-impedance state.
Disabling occurs by pulling pin 8 to the negative supply rail.  It is the task
of the DSP to disable the opamp while the tool is in the CAL or ZERO
mode.  The enable pin of all three power opamps used for the voltage
sources are controlled by the same signal (VDRV_EN).  An RC snubber
(R285 and C354) is attached to the output to suppress high-frequency
oscillations that may occur due to instability in the opamp’s output stage.

Note:  The schematic symbol indicates that the part has 48 pins.  In
reality, there are only 20 pins, which are shown on U31-1.  Pin 21 through
48 were added to the schematic symbol so that thermal vias could be
included in the footprint for heat sinking purposes.


Current Source
The deep driver is a 30 Hz current source used to drive the A5 electrode.
The return is connected to electrode A4.  The deep driver is shown on the
bottom half of sheet 9 of the schematic.

The driver circuit is located at the bottom half of sheet 9 --- a simplified
is forced across R311.  The value of R311 sets the transconductance of

±3.3 VA1, whereas the voltage sources use AGND and ±3.3 VA.  Only the
current source uses the ±3.3 VA1 power supply.  The voltage sources and
other analog circuits use the ±3.3 VA supplies.
2.2.5 PREAMP INTERFACE

All signals between the Controller and Preamp boards are transmitted
differentially.  U15, U97, and U17 are LVDS2 receivers and drivers used
to interface to the Preamp board.  The receive port (RCLK_B, DR_B,
RFS_B) feed into FPGA U16 so that the A/D samples can be collected
and written to FIFO.  Commands are sent to the Preamp board through
the transmit port (TCLK0, TFS0, DT0) which are directly driven by the
DSP’s serial port.  The system clock (MAIN_CLK) and A/D sampling clock
(/MLL_AD_CLK) are provided by FPGA U16.
2.2.6 CAL/VER

A calibration signal and an internal resistor network are included for
diagnostic purposes.  Refer to sheet 12 of the schematic and the
simplified version of Figure 13.
CAL – Opamp U91 A and surrounding resistors form a summing block
that is used to generate a calibration signal for the Preamp.  The CAL

signal is created by adding the individual reference signals to create a
composite waveform consisting of four tones.  Opamp U91 B is used to
generate a complement so that the signal can be sent differentially to the
Preamp board.  The output is passed through analog switches (U94) so
that the signal can be disabled when not in use.

VERIFY – A resistor network provides a load for all the drivers, shunts for
the Bucker’s inputs, and a 12.1Ω resistor for measurement.  When the
tool is in the VERIFY mode, the resistivity, for all modes, should read
12.1Ω (assuming a k-factor of 1).  Relays K1, K2, and K3 are used to
connect the resistor network to the drivers’ output.  Analog switches (U90
and U94) are used to connect the drivers’ sense lines to the resistor
network.  A simplified drawing of this hard-to-follow circuit is shown in

2.2.7 MISCELLANEOUS

Several items on the Controller board have not been covered.  They are
discussed below.

Housing potential: U134 forms a unity-gain buffer used to drive the inner
housing at system common.  The input is taken from the Bucker board’s
common, and the output drives a contact assembly [A3001017000]
located on the chassis.

FPGA power: U1, Q1, and surrounding components form a 2.5 V
regulator to provide the core voltage for the two FPGA’s.


FPGA U9 Functions:

Memory: The FPGA also interfaces to the serial EEPROM (U8).  The
EEPROM is used to store hardware information and calibration tables.
Instead of using a hardware assisted SPI interface, the DSP directly
manipulates the EEPROM signals through a control register.

Glue logic: Glue logic for the flash memory (U5) chip-enable signal is
implemented in the FPGA.  The boot-memory select (/BMS) and
memory-select (/MS0) from the DSP are AND’ed together to generate
/FLS_CE.  On power-up, the DSP initially uses /BMS to load
instructions from flash memory.  After the initial boot process, /MS0 is
used to select the flash memory.  The flash write enable (/FLS_WE) is
generated by OR’ing the /MS0 and /WR signals.

DSP clock: The FPGA also contains a PLL that is used to generate a
32 MHz clock (DSP_CLK) for the DSP.

Temperature Sensor:  FPGA U9 also contains a serial interface for
the temperature sensor (U7).  The serial clock (TEMP_SCLK) runs at
12 MHz.  The FPGA reads the temperature sensor every 0.5 second
and generates an interrupt on /IRQ0.  In response, the DSP reads the
temperature from the FPGA; see timing diagram of Figure 14.

PREAMP BOARD
2.3.1 INTRODUCTION
The Preamp board (A3000644000) contains the signal conditioning and
A/D converters for measuring VM and I0 --- which are the two values
necessary to calculate resistivity.  The Preamp board is responsible for
sampling the VM and I0 signals and sending the A/D samples to the
Controller board (A3000643000).  Each signal is simultaneously
measured with three different gains to increase the dynamic range of the
measurements.  Two-way communication between the Preamp and
Controller is achieved with two synchronous serial ports; each consisting
of a clock, frame sync, and data line.  All signals between the Preamp
and Controller are transmitted and received differentially using LVDS
drivers and receivers.
2.3.2 I0 MEASUREMENT CIRCUITS
I0 current is measured by sensing the voltage across a 2Ω resistor
located on the Bucker board.  Starting at page 2 of the Preamp schematic
(A3000644 SCH), the I0 signal enters the board on pins 4 and 14 of
connector J3.  Resistors R82 and R84, along with diodes D5, form a
clamp to help protect the input from any damaging voltages that may be
present on the A0 electrode --- signal is denoted by A0_I+ and A0_I–.

On page 6 of the schematic, the signal then feeds into a dual, four-input
multiplexer (U21).  The multiplexer is used to select between LOG,
VERIFY, CAL, and ZERO inputs (signal is now CH0+ and CH0–).

Since the I0 measurement has a large amount of gain, it is important to
remove any DC offset in the signal.  The signal ultimately arrives on page
4, where the output of U21 feeds into an AC-coupling network formed by
capacitors C25 & C26, and resistors R108 & R109 to remove this DC
offset.

I0, at this point, is amplified with three different gains.  Three parallel
signal conditioning paths, are similar with the exception of having different
gains, are shown on page 4.  The following description will trace the
signal chain through the highest gain channel which begins with U46.
Keep in mind that the same action is occurring in the two other chains.

U46 is an instrumentation amplifier which amplifies the differential voltage
at its input and produces an output voltage referenced to ground.  The
gain of the device is determined by the value of R110.  With R110 at
49.9Ω, the gain of U46 is 991 V/V.  R111 and C110 form another ac-

An additional gain of 4.01 V/V is provided by the non-inverting gain stage
formed by U57 B.  Afterwards, the signal is scaled and level-shifted by
U57 A.  This stage attenuates the signal by a factor of 2, and applies a
2.5 V offset.  At the output of U57 A, the signal will appear as a smaller,
inverted waveform centered at 2.5 V.

U57 D and its associated components form a Sallen-Key low-pass filter.
The Sallen-Key circuit, along with the pole introduced by capacitor C149,
forms a 3rd order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 4kHz cutoff frequency.

The low-gain channel begins with U22 and has a gain of 10.9 V/V.  The
medium-gain channel begins with U32 and has a gain of 100 V/V.  The
low and medium gain channels are similar to the high gain channel
except that no additional gain is applied after the instrumentation
amplifier.  U55 B and U59 B are simply used as unity gain buffers in their
respective circuits.

The low, medium, and high gain channels are successively sampled
using only one A/D converter.  U26 is a multiplexer used to switch the A/D
input between the outputs of the three channels.  A sampling clock,
provided by the Controller board, initiates three different A/D conversions
– one for each gain channel.  The three channels are sampled in quick
succession, only 6µs apart from each other.  Dual op amp U47 converts
the single-ended input signal into a differential signal (AD2 IN+ and AD2
IN–) that can be sampled by the A/D converter.

U27 is an 18-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter.  A
conversion is initiated by the falling edge on the /CNVST input (pin 35).
This edge causes the A/D to sample the input and begin the conversion
process which takes approximately 1.25µs.  While converting, the A/D
holds its BUSY pin (29) high.  When finished converting, the A/D brings
the BUSY pin low to indicate new data is available to be read.

A serial interface is used to read the A/D.  When reading data, the chip-
select (/CS) pin (32) is pulled low to enable the serial interface.  Data is
shifted out on the SDOUT pin (21) on the rising edge of the serial clock
provided on the SCLK pin (22).

The 2.5 V reference voltage needed by the A/D is externally supplied by
U17.  The A/D internally amplifies the supplied reference to create a
4.096 V reference for conversions.  The internally generated 4.096 V
reference is routed to pin 37 and decoupled by C136.
2.3.3 VM MEASUREMENT CIRCUITS
Two electrodes surround the A0 electrode – M1 and M1’.  These two
electrodes are averaged and buffered by the Bucker board
(A3001215000).  The buffered signal (M1) is fed into the Preamp board

1241 XA Rt Explorer – Circuit Description

Also seen on page 2 is the surface remote signal (REMOTE).  It enters
the board on pin 16 of connector P3.  The surface remote signal is filtered
by a 3rd order Butterworth low-pass filter formed by op amp U48 A and
U48 B --- refer to page 6.  The -3db frequency is 9kHz.  Filtering is
performed to remove any telemetry signals that may be present on
wireline conductor 7.

The REMOTE signal then feeds into a dual, four-input multiplexer (U11).
The multiplexer is used to select between LOG, VERIFY, CAL, and ZERO
inputs (signal is now CH1+ and CH1–).  The signal ultimately arrives on
page 5, where the output of U11 feeds into an AC-coupling network
formed by capacitors C17 & C18, and resistors R86 & R87.  These
components remove any DC offset in the signal.

The VM measurement circuit on page 5 is identical to the previously
described I0 circuit on page 4 with the exception of some resistor values.
Although three gain channels are available at the present time, only the
low-gain channel, which begins with U9, is used.  The front-end
instrumentation amplifiers (U12 and U44) for the medium and high-gain
channels are set to a gain of 1 V/V, because higher gains caused the
amplifiers to saturate and adversely affect the low-gain channel
measurement.  Although the A/D actively samples the medium and high-
gain channels, calculations do not utilize these channels.

The two A/D’s, U27 (for I0) and U18 (for VM), are daisy-chained so that
the FPGA can read both A/D’s using one data line.  The serial data output
of U18 (pin 21) feeds into the serial data input of U27 (pin 16).  The FPGA
shifts in data from the serial data output of U27.  In this manner, the
FPGA can read both A/D’s in one 36-bit long bit-stream --- U27 data first,
followed by U18 data.
2.3.4 A/D DATA RETRIEVAL
The sampling clock (/MLL_AD_CLK), provided by the Controller board,
initiates the conversion process for the A/D’s.  The differential clock inputs
enter the Preamp board on pins 23 and 11 of connector P2.  At U34, a
differential driver, it is converted into standard logic levels and routed to
the FPGA (page 3).

Refer to the timing diagram of Figure 15.  At point A, after the rising edge
of /MLL_AD_CLK, the FPGA (U29) collects three samples from each A/D
converter.  The AD_CNVST signal is pulsed low (point B) to initiate each
of the three A/D conversions.  On the falling edge of AD_CNVST, the
A/D’s sample their inputs and bring their respective busy lines high (point
C).  The FPGA monitors both busy lines and waits for them to go low
before reading the results from the A/D’s.  After the busy lines go low, the

1241 XA Rt Explorer – Circuit Description
131042-945 / 1241 XA
AUG 2009
Baker Atlas
In addition to reading the conversion results after the busy lines go low,
the FPGA also updates the mux select lines for U26 and U16 to select the
next gain channel in preparation for the next conversion.  The gain
channels are consecutively sampled 6µs apart in the following order: low,
medium, high --- see Figure 15.



samples are being transferred to the Controller board.  Refer to the timing
sampling clock pulse before sending them to the Controller board.  To do
this, the FPGA transfers the contents of a shift register into the transmit
buffers on the falling edge (point E) of the sampling clock.  Thereafter, it
waits 10µs before sending the samples.  The samples are sent to the
Controller board through a synchronous serial link consisting of RCLK,
RFS, and DR.  RCLK is a serial clock running at 24 MHz.  RFS is a frame
sync which goes low when data is driven out on the data line, DR.  Figure
16 illustrates the serial port in relation to the sampling clock.

The Preamp board sends twelve words instead of six.  The extra six
words are due to the fact that the FPGA was originally designed for a
board which had more channels.  Zeroes are transmitted in place of the

1241 XA Rt Explorer – Circuit Description
131042-945 / 1241 XA
AUG 2009
Baker Atlas

The Preamp board can receive commands from the Controller board for
performing specific tasks.  This communication occurs through another
synchronous serial link consisting of TCLK, TFS, and DT.

TCLK operates at 12 MHz.  TFS is the frame sync and DT is the data line.
A command word is 16 bits long.  The Controller sends commands to…
1) enable the acquisition,
2) select the operating mode (LOG, VERIFY, CAL, or ZERO),
3) select the attenuation level for the cal signal, or
4) tell the Preamp to return a status word.
Differential signals from the Controller arrive at connector P2.  Clock
signals are found on pins 2 and 15; frame syncs are found on pins 3 and
16, and the data lines are pins 4 and 17.  These signals find their way to
U20, a LVDS chip (page 3).  U20 converts them into standard logic levels
useable by the FPGA, U29.
2.3.6 CALIBRATION CIRCUIT
A calibration signal (DRV_CAL±) is provided by the Controller board.
This signal arrives at the Preamp board via connector P3 pins 19 and 10.
The signal is a composite waveform created by summing four sinusoids
with frequencies of 30 Hz, 105 Hz, 165 Hz, and 195 Hz.  The calibration
signal, observed at the output of U9 while in the CAL mode, is shown
below in Figure 17.
The objective of the calibration routine is to determine the relative gain
and phase-shifts between the channels.  Absolute gain is not needed

Hence, any common gain error between the two channels will be divided
out.  The VM low-gain channel is used as the reference for calibration.
The gain and phase of the low, medium, and high gain I0 channels are
determined with respect to the low-gain VM channel.


be applied to the calibration signal, depending on the gain of the channel
being calibrated.  The full cal signal is applied when calibrating the low-
gain VM channel.
When calibrating the I0 channels which have more gain, the cal signal
has to be attenuated to a level within the input range of the channel.  The
low-gain I0 channel is calibrated with the 1/21 attenuation.  The medium
and high-gain I0 channels are calibrated with 1/201 and 1/2001
attenuation, respectively.  Attenuation levels are selected by U41, a dual
4-to-1 mux.  The Controller board selects the attenuation level by
programming the appropriate bits of a control register in the FPGA.  The
enable input of the calibration mux allows the mux output to be tri-stated
when the tool is not in the CAL mode.  This feature helps reduce any
potential cross-talk.

Multiplexers (U21 and U11) at the front end of the measurement channels
provide support for the various tool operating modes: LOG, VERIFY,
CAL, and ZERO.  The Controller sets the operating mode by
programming the mode control bits in the FPGA’s control register.  The
mode control bits drive the mux select lines A_CAL_GAIN_SEL0 and
A_CAL_GAIN_SEL1.
In the CAL mode, both VM and I0 measure the cal signal.
In the ZERO mode, the inputs of each channel are shorted together.
Resistors R145 and R146 allow the inputs to be tied to common, but they

The LOG and VERIFY inputs for the I0 channel are the same.  In both
cases, the I0 channel measures the voltage across a 2Ω resistor on the
Bucker board.  For the VM channel, M1 is applied to the positive input in
both the LOG and VERIFY modes.  Surface remote is applied to the
negative input in the LOG mode, while in the VERIFY mode, the A5 node
of the verify network is applied to the negative input.
2.3.7 FPGA AND SUPPORT CIRCUITRY
On page 3 of the schematic is an Actel field programmable gate array
(FPGA), U29.
Among its functions are…
•
It contains the logic for collecting the A/D samples and sending them
to the Controller board.
•
It also contains a control register through which the Controller board
can set the operating mode (LOG, VERIFY, CAL, ZERO) and
attenuation setting of the calibration signal.
•
The system clock is obtained from MAIN_CLK because there is no
local oscillator on the board.
•
The FPGA is programmed to blink LED D9 once a second.  This may
be helpful in determining if the FPGA is functioning.

FPGA support features…
•
Connector P1: is a programming header used for programming the
FPGA.  It is intended for engineering use only.
•
Power Supply: the 2.5 V supply needed for the FPGA’s core is
provided by a low-dropout regulator formed by U35 and Q2 found on
page 2 of the schematic.  The 2.5 V reference is derived from the 3.3 V
supply using a voltage divider – R53 and R54.  Through feedback,
opamp U35 adjusts the base voltage of Q2 so that the voltage at its
non-inverting input equals the reference voltage presented at the
inverting input.  To prevent this supply from exceeding 3.3 V,
protection diode D18 is installed.
•
Isolation: the analog and digital sections of the board are isolated
from each other.  All signals between the FPGA and analog section
are isolated by U51, U52, U53, and U54.  These IC’s are digital
isolators that magnetically couple digital signals from one side to the
other.

LVDS: all signals between the Preamp and Controller are transmitted and
received differentially using LVDS drivers and receivers (U20, U34, and
U30).  Low-voltage differential signaling is a standard allowing for high
data rates with low power and low EMI.  The receivers detect differential
signals and convert them to standard logic.  Each receiver has a 100Ω
termination resistor across the input.  The differential voltage is typically
only ±310mV.

Refer to the schematic diagram (A3001215 SCH) of the Bucker board
(A3001215000) for the following description.

Survey current must enter/leave the A0 electrode horizontally into the formation
rather than vertically through the mud to obtain a formation resistivity
measurement.  This objective is achieved by minimizing the potential difference
between the M2 and M1 electrodes.  The Bucker board contains a high-gain
amplifier used to adjust this potential difference.  With negative feedback, and
assuming infinite gain, the Bucker amplifier forces the potential difference
between M2 and M1 to zero.

There are actually two sets of electrodes; M2 (P1-18) and M1 (P1-5) in the upper
array, and their complements M2' (P1-20) and M1' (P1-7) in the bottom array.  As
a result, the Bucker board amplifies the difference between the average voltages
of these two sets of electrodes.  RN1 and RN2 are precision matched resistors
used to determine the average voltage of M1 and M1' (IN+) and the average
voltage of M2 and M2' (IN–), respectively.  The average of M1 and M1' is
buffered by U5 A and routed off board (P1-9) so that it can be measured by the
Preamp board.  U5 B buffers the average of M2 and M2' but its output is not used.
Its sole purpose is to balance any loading U5 A may have on the M1/M1' input.

The overall frequency response of the Bucker is shaped to provide a high gain
within the frequency range of interest: 30 Hz to 195 Hz.  The gain is reduced at
frequencies outside of this region.  The overall gain is distributed among three
stages:
1) front-end instrumentation amplifier U1,
2) inverting amplifier formed by U2 B, and
3) a non-inverting amplifier formed by U2 A.

The first stage of amplification is U1.  It is an instrumentation amplifier which
provides a gain of 10 V/V.  The gain of this amplifier is determined by the value of
R5.
The output of U1 is AC-coupled to an inverting amplifier formed by U2 B.  The ratio
of R10 and R9 sets the passband gain of this stage to approximately 52.5 V/V.
The gain of this stage rolls off at frequencies above 214 Hz (F-3dB), as determined
by the values of C8 and R10.
U2 A forms a non-inverting gain stage.  Because of C5, the DC gain is limited to
1 V/V.  The value of R4 and R6 determine the passband gain, which is
approximately 16 V/V.  The gain of this stage also rolls off at frequencies above
214 Hz (F-3dB), as determined by the values of C7 and R4.

Finally, U3 is a power opamp with a high current output.  The output current limit
is programmable and set by resistor R14.  With R14 chosen to be 46.4kΩ, the
current limit is set at 250mA.  R8 is a precision current-sense resistor used to

measure the output current of the Bucker circuit.  The resistor has 4 terminals for
a “four-wire” measurement.  The sense terminals are routed off-board so that the
survey current (I0) can be measured by the Preamp board.  R8 is enclosed within
the feedback loop of U3 so that the output voltage is not affected by the IR drop
through the sense resistor.

Note:  The schematic symbol indicates that the part has 48 pins.  In reality, there
are only 20 pins, which are shown on U31-1.  Pin 21 through 48 (labeled
U3-2) were added to the schematic symbol so that thermal vias could be
included in the footprint for heat dissipation.

Power amplifier U3 cannot be powered directly from the +5 V supply that powers
the other active circuit components of this board.  Due to its limited supply
voltage rating, U3 has ±2.75 V provided to it by separate voltage regulators.  The
+2.75 V regulator is formed by U7 A, Q1, and surrounding components.  The
+2.75 V reference is derived from the +5 V supply using a voltage divider – R27
and R28.  Through feedback, opamp U7 A adjusts the base voltage of Q1 so that
the voltage at its non-inverting input equals the reference voltage presented at
the inverting input.

A similar circuit is provided for the –2.75 V regulator.  It is formed by U7 B, Q2,
and surrounding components.  Its operation is similar to the +2.75 V regulator.

Relays K1 and K2 are provided to support the VERIFY mode.  In the VERIFY
mode, the Bucker’s inputs and output are redirected to connect to an internal
resistor network on the Controller board (A3000643000) instead of the

MISCELLANEOUS
2.5.1 OTHER PC BOARDS
Several other PC boards of relative insignificance reside in the 1241 XA.
Two of these boards are nothing more than tie points where wires attach
and make assembly/disassembly/repair easier.  The first one of these
(A3000877000) is at the uphole end of the instrument.  It is shown on the
The second one is located between the chassis-mounted transformers
and the Controller board; it is the Signal Distribution board, SDB,
(A3000755000).  Wires from this board connect the electrodes (contact
blocks) and from the Main Controller board.
Just to the downhole side of the Controller board is a small PC board
(A3000773000) containing the four signal transformers used for Focus
bus communications.  Although requiring more wire terminations, this
board relieves the Controller board from mounting these relatively bulky
and heavy items from the board containing sensitive electronics (vibration
issues).
A final set of two boards (A3001788000) are mounted on the fiberglass
rod assembly.  The main purpose of these boards is to control the path of
wiring to the monitor electrode (M1, M2, M1’, M2’) sockets.  Due to the
sensitive nature of the monitor electrodes to interference, a well-defined
route is required.  The PC boards were put in place to provide a clean
junction for the shielded twisted pairs and the socket leads.
2.5.2 CHASSIS TRANSFORMERS
Three step-down transformers are mounted on the chassis between the
upper power supplies and the Signal Distribution board.  They provide a
current boost for the voltage drivers, VF1, VF2 and VF3.  The wires from
the transformers connect to their related chassis components using
chassis terminals.  By boosting the output current by a 6 to 1 ratio, less
current is needed by the driver opamp and the power supplies.
2.5.3 CONTACTS
Electrical contact is made from the outside world (each electrode) to the
internal circuits by means of 22 special feedthrough pins.  The larger
diameter portion of this pin is threaded, and screws into the electrode to
make contact with it.  The narrower section is rounded on the end to fit
into a receptacle.  In between these two sections is an isolating section.
A ceramic coating is sprayed on this section to insulate the pin from

accidentally shorting out to the housing as it passes through to the interior
contact block.
The receptacles or contact blocks, as mentioned earlier, are free-floating
in cavities of the fiberglass rod assembly.  Being magnetically coupled to
magnets mounted in the rod such that they attract, the contact blocks are
free to slide up/down inside their slot.  This movement not only allows the
block to automatically align with the pin (upon insertion), but also relieves
any stresses that occur during thermal expansion.
2.5.4 TOP/BOTTOM CONNECTORS
The top connector, J1, of the 1241 XA is a standard 18-socket Focus
connector.  Should it be required, replacement of this connector is made
easy because all wires coming from it terminate at the uphole terminal
board, TB1.
Likewise the bottom connector, J9, is a standard 18-socket Focus
connector.  However, it is augmented with a bottom sub and an 18-pin

POWER SUPPLY CIRCUITRY
The 1241 XA RTeX has six DC power supplies mounted on the electronics
backbone – one ±5 volts and five 3.3 volts.  Refer to the assembly drawing
A3001823000 and the associated PC boards A3000558000 (-SCH for schematic)
and A3000976000 (-SCH for schematic).
Along with the supplies are EMI filter modules that drastically reduce interference
and interaction between supplies of other Focus instruments.  Refer to drawing
A3000467000 (-SCH for schematic) to view the filter assembly board.
The six supplies mount on heat-sink blocks for heat dissipation, but the filters
mount only on standoffs.
Note the table below and observe the purpose of each of the power supplies.  It

2.6.1 DUAL 5 V POWER SUPPLY
There is only one dual polarity power supply (PS6); its output is ±5 volts.
The Focus ±5 V Power Supply (A3000558000) supplies a regulated
output voltage of ±5.0 Vdc at 0.5 Amp load current, per output, from an
input voltage of 18 Vdc to 36 Vdc; 28 Vdc is typical.

kHz and employs a single-transistor discontinuous-mode flyback
topology.  Operation is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) IC
that controls chopping (switching) of the 28 Vdc input voltage at a fixed
frequency (300 kHz).  Each switching cycle is subdivided into three
operating intervals: conduction, flyback, and dead time.
Current flows in the primary of the flyback transformer and magnetic
energy is stored in the transformer’s air gap during the conduction
interval.  The power supplies’ output capacitors maintain the output
voltage.
When the conduction interval terminates, stored magnetic energy is
released to the secondary of the transformer and the power supplies’
output capacitors are charged.  The supply is designed such that the

conduction interval (ton) varies according to the demand placed on the
power supply to maintain a constant output voltage.
The dead time interval commences when all stored magnetic energy is
depleted. Again the output capacitors maintain the output voltage.  The
dead-time interval ends on the rising edge of the next PWM clock, which
also marks the start of the next conduction interval.
For the following equation it can be seen that as Vin and/or Io change,
the PWM re-adjusts ton to maintain a constant Vo.

ton is the conduction time

Vo is the regulated ±5.0 Vdc output

Io is the ±5.0 Vdc output current

Lp is the Flyback transformer's primary inductance

Output voltage sensing or error detection compares the output voltage to
a stable reference voltage and a resulting error voltage is created on the
secondary side.  Magnetic coupling conveys the error voltage to the
primary side where the error voltage modulates the PWM and adjusts ton.
Magnetically-coupled feedback permits operation with the power supplies’
output return floating or isolated from the input return.

Detailed Circuit Description
Chip U1, a Vishay Si9110, provides the required PWM functions.
Resistor R2 sets the internal clock frequency of the PWM to
approximately 600 kHz, which is twice the chopping or switching
frequency (Figure 19).  The bias current of U1 is set by resistor R3.
Diode D15 and associated components shift U1’s soft-reference voltage
to improve operation at elevated temperature.
Transistor Q1 buffers the output of the PWM and provides the additional
current drive needed to rapidly switch mosfet Q2 on and off (Figure 20).
Mosfet Q2 controls the application of supply voltage to the primary of the
flyback transformer T2.  When Q2 is on, the primary current ramps up at
a rate determined by T2 and Vin.  Transformer T1, a 1:100 current
transformer, couples the primary current to diode D9 and resistor R9.
Resistor R9 converts the primary current ramp to a voltage ramp.
Resistor R8 and capacitor C18 filter the voltage ramp and apply it to U1
(Figure 21) at the “sense” pin.  The error voltage at U1-14 is internally

Transformer T2 has four secondary windings; two windings provide power
supply operating voltages, while the third and fourth windings provide the
main ±5.0-volt outputs.  The secondary winding associated with rectifier
D13 provides approximately 5.0 Vdc for powering the circuitry on the
primary side of T2.  Rectifier D6 and associated components provide
approximately 5.0 Vdc for powering the circuitry on the secondary side of
T2.  Components D4, D5, C23, C24, C30, and C31 constitute the main
rectifier and filter circuit for the ±5.0 Vdc outputs.  The ±5.0 Vdc outputs
are further filtered by L3, C25, C32, C36, C26, C27, C53, C55, C33, C34,
C56, and C57 before application to output terminals E4, E5, and E6
(Figure 23).
Chip U5 and associated components constitute the output voltage
sensing or error detection circuitry.  Chip U5 compares the ±5.0 Vdc
output voltages divided down by R31 and R32 to the 2.5 Vdc reference
voltage provided by U2.  The output of U5 is buffered by Q5 whose
emitter drives T3.  Components R40, C49, and C50 provide negative
feedback to the inverting input of U5 to shape the loop gain, which
ensures stable operation and adequate transient response.  The voltage
at the emitter of Q5 is the error voltage.  To couple the DC error voltage
through T3, it is necessary to use amplitude modulation such that the
error signal can be magnetically coupled to the secondary side of T3.
Chip U4 provides a ~700-kHz carrier, which is amplitude modulated by
the error voltage applied through the center tap of T3.  Diode D12 with
C14 and R15 serve to demodulate or recover the magnetically coupled
modulated error voltage signal.  Components C52 and R42 provide
additional error voltage signal filtering (Figure 26).  Chip U3 with R12,
R35, R13, R14, R4, and C15 further amplify and filter the error voltage.
Due to the interleaving of the main secondary winding, the -5.0 Vdc
output closely tracks the +5.0 Vdc output, provided that the negative load
current is not less than 20% of the positive load current.
Transistor Q3, chip U3, and associated components provide a soft start
function, which ensures that the ±5.0-Vdc output ramps up in predictable
manner.  Transistor Q3 is on when INH (E3) is held low, which keeps C8
discharged.  Chip U3-7 is also low to maintain C11 discharged through
D7.  When Q3 is released, both capacitors are allowed to charge,
controlling the rate at which the ±5.0-Vdc output ramps up (Figure 25).
Transistor Q4, diodes D2, D1, and D8, and associated passive
components provide +10 Vdc start-up power for the primary side
components.  Once the power supply starts and the secondary outputs
come up, the winding associated with D13 provides the primary operating
power, i.e.; the power supply becomes self sustaining, producing its own
operating power.  The 5.0-Vdc output from D13 and D2 (5, 2) provide a
reverse bias to D2 (3, 4), which turns Q4 off for improved efficiency.
Capacitors C1, C2, C5 through C7 and C9 minimize the differential and
common-mode noise on the 28-Vdc line.  Also, C1 and C2 provide a low
inductance voltage source for the primary power circuit consisting of Q2

and T2.  Capacitor C10 and resistor R16 serve to dampen the ringing on
the drain of Q2 at turn off.

Tracing Through A Cycle Of Operation
Assume that the output of PWM U1-4 has gone high, turning on Q2 and
marking the start of the conduction interval.  Vin (+28 Vdc) appears
across the primary of T2 and the primary current of T2 begins to ramp up
linearly.  Diodes D13, D4, D5, and D6 are reversed biased during this
interval since the secondaries’ polarity is inverted with respect to the
primary.  Output current from each secondary is supplied by capacitors
C44, C23, C24, C30, C31, and C39 during this interval.  As previously
discussed, the primary current is fed back to the PWM sense input (U1-
3), after being converted to a voltage.  The ramp voltage internal to the
PWM is compared to the error voltage and when the ramp voltage is
greater than the error voltage, the output of the PWM goes low, causing
Q2 to turn off.  This designates the end of the conduction interval and the
start of the flyback interval.
Since the current flowing in an inductor can not be instantaneously
stopped, current must continue to flow in T2 even though Q2 is off.
When Q2 turns off, the primary voltage reverses and increases until the
secondary rectifier diodes are forward biased and conducting (Figure 22).
Current that was flowing in the primary is now transferred to the
secondary.  The current that flows in each secondary winding is a
function of its turns ratio.  Secondary current primarily flows through
capacitors C44, C23, C24, C30, C31, and C39, restoring their charge.
Secondary current will continue to flow until all magnetic energy stored in
the air gap of T2 is transferred to the output capacitors (electric field
energy).
The dead-time interval now commences.  During this interval all power
switching components (Q2, D13, D4, D5, and D6) are off, hence the
name discontinuous mode (no switching current flows during the dead-
time interval).  The only current flowing is the load current, which is
provided by the output capacitors.  On the next clock edge the cycle
repeats.

2.6.3 INPUT FILTER BOARDS

There are two Input Filter boards for the six power supplies.  The Input
Filter and Delay Controller PCB Assembly (A3000467000) provides
common mode and differential mode filtering of the +28 Vdc input voltage
for up to three power supply modules.  It also provides low-voltage inhibit
and programmable start-up delays for the attached supplies.  Refer to
differential and common mode filter.  The filter attenuates switching
frequency harmonics of the power supply modules attached to connector
J1and prevents noise contamination of the 28 V bus.
The heart of the delay controller is a programmable microcontroller (U1).
Resistor R7 and capacitor C12 set the operating frequency at
approximately 1 MHz.  Diode D1 and R6 function as a simple Zener
power supply that provides 5 V for the microcontroller.
When enabled, U1 functions as a timer to control the turn-on time and
sequencing of the power-supply modules attached to connector J1.
There are basically three functions concerning this circuit: (1) a voltage
threshold, (2) the delay and sequencing circuit and (3), the control/inhibit
circuit.
(1)
A threshold voltage is established using a voltage divider
consisting of R4 and R5.  When the divider output exceeds 1.25 V
as detected by power fail input (PFI) U2-4, the RESET pin (U2-7)
goes high.  This happens when voltage on the 28 V bus exceeds
20 volts or more.  With U2’s reset pin high, U1’s MCLR (U1-4) is
pulled high, and U1 begins executing its internally stored program.
(2)
The delay provided by U1 is the time from when U1’s MCLR goes
high to the time INH1 (J1-4) goes high.  Different combinations of
jumpers JP1 – JP4 change U1’s delay time.  Delay times are
established for different tools to limit the current demand when the
tool string is first powered up.  Delay times, in milliseconds, and

JP4 + JP2, etc.


In addition, jumper JP6 determines if INH2 (J1-7) and INH3 (J1-
10) go high simultaneously with INH1 or are staggered by 40
msec.  The two states of jumper JP6 are as follows:
•
JP6 jumpered = staggered High-to-Low transition of RA1 – RA3
•
JP6 not jumpered = Simultaneous High-to-Low transition of RA1
– RA3

(3)
When +5 volts is applied to the microcontroller, outputs RA1 –
RA3 of U1 are floating (open collector circuit).  Resistors R8, R12,
and R14 pull the bases of Q1 – Q3 HIGH respectively, turning on
Q1 – Q3, which result in INH1 – INH3 being pulled low.  This low
state inhibits operation of the power supply modules connected to
INH1 – INH3.  When U1’s time-out function is complete, outputs
RA1 – RA3 will transition LOW either simultaneously or staggered
as determined by jumper JP6, turning off Q1 – Q3, which activates
the power supply modules.

Because very little power is dissipated on this board, there is no need to
mount it on a heat sink.  Therefore, it is mounted to the electronics
chassis using standoffs."

The Rt Explorer instrument for the Focus tool string is the series 1241 XA, whereas the
1249 XA is the WTS version.  In both cases the outward appearance is a series of guard
electrodes located on a specially designed titanium housing.  The electronics assembly is
located within the housing.  See sketch of Figure 1.


the electronics to be incorporated within the mandrel to reduce the overall length of the
instrument.
Electronics Chassis Assembly
Electronic circuits and discrete parts mount on an I-beam chassis and include the
following components.
•
Six DC power supplies,
•
Controller board containing communication interface, guard drivers, data
acquisition and control circuits, calibration and verification circuits, etc.
•
Preamp board containing circuits for measuring VM1 and I0 (read as I zero), as
well as a means for sending them to the Controller board,
•
Bucker board provides the survey current,
•
Various chassis mounted components.

Physical Attributes
For an overview of how the major instrument components electrically and sometimes
mechanically, tie together, see the block diagram of Figure 2.

Electrode Rings: Twenty one electrode rings encircle the housing and connect to the
inner electronics using feedthroughs.  Electrode pairs are spaced along the
mandrel at specific distances to achieve varying depths of investigation.  The
electrode rings have a mild steel surface to promote rusting and it is this rust that
makes a better electrical “contact” to the borehole fluids.  A fiberglass layer
isolates the electrode rings from the inner titanium housing.

1 VM is the voltage measurement of the M1 electrode relative to the surface remote.  I0 is the

A4 and A4': Metal end pieces of the housing also serve as electrodes, A4 and A4'.  Two
isolation joints within the housing separate these two end pieces from the inner
housing.  Instruments connected above and below the RTeX extend the electrical
length of the A4 electrodes.  Springs mounted on the top and bottom snorkel
sections of the chassis make contact to the end pieces through the electronics.
Fiberglass: A fiberglass assembly holds all the contact sockets that mate with the
feedthroughs.  Each contact is loosely held in place by a set of magnets so that it
has freedom to align with the feedthrough.
Copper Pipes: Copper pipes are attached to the bottom side of the fiberglass assembly.
Their purpose is to provide a low-resistance connection between the top and
bottom guard electrode pairs: A1-A1’, A2-A2’, A3-A3' and A4-A4'.  Each pipe has
a different outer diameter so that they fit inside one another.  Kapton tape is
wrapped around each pipe for insulation.  Connection to A5 and A5' is made with
a wire that runs through the center of these pipes.
Chassis Potential: A spring-loaded contact assembly on the chassis provides
connection to the inner housing.  Rather than leaving the inner housing floating, a
unity-gain buffer, found on the Main Controller board, is used to maintain the

Item numbers in brackets refer to drawing A3000646000 unless otherwise noted.

NOTICE:
To avoid damage to Feed-through Pins [15], remove all 22 of them first,
(use Feed-through Removal Tool [18]).  ACCOUNT FOR ALL 22 OF
THEM BEFORE PROCEEDING.

Each Feed-through Pin has additional hardware.  Be careful not to
lose any of the Grommets [14], Spacers [16] or O-rings [13].  See
View B on the drawing.

Anytime Feed-through Pins are removed, reassemble with new
hardware.  Discard the old O-rings [13], Grommets [14] and Spacers
[16]; do not reuse the old ones.

Inspect all Feed-through Pins [15] for cracks in the ceramic coating.
Be sure they are in good working condition, as they will be reused.
Replace if necessary.  These are all critical points for pressure
leakage and tool failure.  Only parts of good integrity should be used
when re-assembling the instrument.

_____1.
With all Feed-through Pins removed, remove the Pin Thread Protector
[3] from the uphole end by rotating the Split Collar [12] with a Spanner
Wrench.
_____2.
Remove the downhole Thread Protector [11] by unscrewing it.
_____3.
Rotate the Split Collar [5] until the Bottom Sub [8] is free and then
remove it.
_____4.
Remove the Chassis Lock Nut [4] using Lock Nut Tool [19].  This frees
up the chassis for removal.  Push the uphole connector with something
firm, yet soft, (like the wooden handle of a hammer) until the Chassis is
exposed on the downhole end sufficiently to grab.
_____5.
At the downhole end, pull the Electronics and Fiberglass Rod Assembly
[1] out of the Fiberglass Housing [2].

NOTICE:
Due to the length of this Chassis, removal is always a two-man operation.
To avoid damage to the Chassis, when the Chassis is approximately
halfway exposed, rotate the I-beam until it is oriented vertically --- this will
afford the greatest rigidity when handling.  Always carry with the I-beam

_____6.
As the Chassis exits the Housing, be sure to support it to prevent
bending and avoid damaging any internal parts.  It is recommended to
place the Chassis on a suitable workbench to support it along its entire
length.  If placed on tool stands, use the Chassis Supports [24] at each
contact point, and support it with no less that four stands.
Note: If work is to be done on the Electronics or PC board assemblies, use proper
ESD safeguards."

In the rare event that a roller assembly or grounding assembly must be
replaced, the Fiberglass Rod Assembly [2] will have to be removed to
access their mounting screws.  Also, if the copper pipes must be
accessed for any reason, the Fiberglass Rod Assembly will have to be
removed.
_____8.
To remove the Fiberglass Rod [2], locate the several sets of screws
along the backbone that hold it to the chassis.  There is a set of four
fixed screws at the uphole end.  There are also three sets (two screws
each) of floating points in slotted holes used to fasten it to the Chassis
and allow for the difference in the rates of expansion between the
fiberglass rod and the metal chassis.  Locate and remove the ten screws
total holding it.
a. The fixed set of 4 screws is found on either side of the first (uphole)
roller assembly between two power supplies.  Using a nut driver,
hold the lock nuts [20] and unscrew the socket-head cap screws
[19].  Retain all hardware for installation later.
b. The first set of floating points is beneath the Main Controller PCBA
[13].  It will have to be removed first, before you can access the
screws [3] holding the rod.  See section A-A for details.
c. The second set is between the PreAmp PCBA [14] and the Bucker

NOTICE:
The uphole Snorkel consists of two pieces --- an isolator PEEK portion
[20] and a metal portion [2].  These two parts should not require
separation during the life of the tool; but if they are separated, putting
them back together can be tricky.  There are four distinct positions that
the Top Snorkel [2] can have in relation to the Isolation Snorkel [20]
because the four mating screw holes are exactly 90º apart.  Only one of
these four positions is correct.  Rotate the metal snorkel [2] such that pin
1 position of the Connector [1] matches the position of the key on the

INSTALLING THE ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLY
Item numbers in brackets refer to BOM item numbers found on drawing A3000646000.

1. With any repairs made to the Electronics, install the Electronics Chassis [1] by
carefully sliding it into the Fiberglass Housing [2].

NOTICE:
Due to the length of this Chassis, installation is always a two-man
operation.  To avoid damage to the Chassis, carry the I-beam such that it
is oriented vertically as this will afford the greatest rigidity when handling.
Always carry with the I-beam vertical.

2. Keep the I-beam vertical until it is mostly installed.  Place the Chassis Installation
Tool [17] onto the downhole end and push the Chassis in as far as possible.
Rotate the Chassis until you feel the locating pin match with its mating slot, then
push the Chassis in until it bottoms out.
3. Look into each Feed-through hole to ensure that the Contact Block associated
with it is aligned with the hole before proceeding further.  If the Contact Block
cannot be aligned with a scribe or dental tool, pull the Chassis back out and try to
better center the Block in its cavity before sliding it back in.  These Blocks must
be in place for the Feed-through to be installed later.
4. This step assures that contact blocks are properly aligned before proceeding to
next steps of installing Contact pins [15].  Using Socket Alignment tool [29], insert
into each hole and capture its contact block.  Then screw it in until it hits bottom.
When it hits bottom, flat part should be flush with the housing as shown below.

131042-955 / 1241 XA
JUNE 2013

7. Lubricate all O-rings [13] with silicone oil [31]. This is most easily accomplished
by dipping the O-rings in a small cup filled with silicone oil. Afterwards, remove
O-rings and place them on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.

Note: The silicone oil will help seat the O-rings into the ports and make it
easier to push the pins [15] through the O-rings. If not properly lubricated,
the O-ring may be damaged as the contact pin [15] is pushed through the
O-ring.

8. Install a lubricated O-ring [13] in each of the 22 electrode ports. See Figure 3.

a. Manually insert the O-ring into the port. Gently press the O-ring into
the port to get it started.

b. Use the O-ring installation tool [30] to press on the O-ring and fully
seat it in the port. See Figure 4.

Note: It is highly recommended to use the O-ring installation tool [30] to
seat the O-rings. Use of any other tool or object may result in nicks or other
damage to the O-ring.

9. Insert a new Spacer [16] in each of the electrode ports. See Figure 3.

10. Take a new Grommet [14] and slide it over the Contact Pin [15] so that the broad
shoulder is up against the head of the Pin (see View B on drawing). Apply a thin
film of synthetic grease [22] around the base of the grommet. See Figure 2.

Note: Ensure grease encompasses the entire 360°. This is important for
creating a good seal.
11. Repeat these steps for all 22 Feed-throughs.
12. After all Feed-throughs are installed (confirming no leftover parts), finish
tightening with a torque screwdriver set to 36 in-lb.  Allow the Pins to sit overnight
and tighten again using the 36 in-lb setting.  This allows time for the grease to
settle and allows the Pin to bottom out on the Spacer.  Note: when completed
correctly, the Contact Pin should not extend beyond the O.D. of the housing.

If performance has deteriorated over time, it could be that the specially designed housing has developed
leakage that is out of specification.  Remove the electronics from the housing and perform the following
checks.

_____1.
When removing the electronics, remove all feedthroughs and save them for later use.
Clean them before reuse.
_____2.
Concerning the feedthroughs, remove all O-rings, grommets, and spacers.  Discard the
O-rings and grommets --- new ones will be installed upon reassembly.  Clean the
spacers and save them for later use.
_____3.
Continue the disassembly process using the procedure found in manual section 131042-
955.
_____4.
Use a Megohmmeter to measure the resistance between adjacent electrode pairs listed
in Table 1 below.  Use the shiny edges of each electrode for contact points.  Verify that
all readings are greater than 100 KΩ.  Test at 500 V --- do not test at voltages greater
than 500 V.
Definition: an electrode for this instrument is a band that encompasses the outer diameter of the housing.
It is a machined surface (shiny) that has been impregnated with a coating in its center that rusts.  Thus, it
appears as a rusted surface surrounded by two thin bands of shiny metal (see Figure 1 for proper
positioning of meter leads to perform this test).  Each electrode is isolated from the adjacent electrode by
a rubberized insulator.  It is the insulator properties that we are seeking to measure.

1241XA-RTEX-AMO,1241XA Level 3 Preventive Maintenance ........................... - 1.0 INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION
Level 3 maintenance should be performed on the 1241 XA Rt Explorer Instrument
every four months to ensure the integrity of the service.  It would be extremely helpful
to know the status of the electronics before starting anything.  If electronics meets
the Communication test and functional testing described in 131042-956, there are no
electrical parts to replace.  However, several components should be verified that they
are secured to prevent failure.  There are several O-Rings that must be replaced.
These and other steps are listed below.  Parts list 131042-843 shows only those
parts that must be replaced, other parts that may be needed for repair are listed in
the spare parts list, 131042-841."

The 1241 XB Hybrid RTeX is a converted Focus 1241 XA
RTeX.  Its conversion allows it to operate mechanically and
electrically in a WTS tool string, but only at Focus
temperatures.  Since the design was originally DC powered, it
must convert the WTS AC-supplied source to Focus DC using
a crossover adapter.  Connected above the instrument, the
crossover 1241 PA adapter (131068000) performs this power
conversion and provides the mechanical WTS connection.
The bottom connector is both mechanically and electrically
WTS compatible as well.  Other than these differences, the
service provided is the same as the Focus 1241 XA Rt
Explorer.
Note: the top of the 1241 XB is a Titanium spin collar
that should only mate with the 1241 PA and should not
be broken at the wellsite; it is not a “field joint.”
The resistivity value of the uninvaded formation, Rt, is critical
for calculation of water saturation.  In a highly conductive
borehole and high resistivity formations, galvanic tools
consisting of an array of both current injecting and voltage
measuring electrodes, like the Rt Explorer (RTeX), are the
preferred instruments.
The complete Focus RTeX system consists of not only the
RTeX electrode mandrel, but also the housings of other
instruments above and below.  The RTeX mandrel contains
the electrodes (center electrode and guards) needed for the
measurement of the shallowest resistivity (MLR1) and two
intermediate diameters of investigation (MLR2 and MLR3).
Observe the instrument sketch on the right.  The guard
electrodes are symmetrical around the center electrode A0,

with M1, M2, A1, A2 and A3 situated on the mandrel itself.  This system can be
thought of as an array of four laterologs, LL7 type, with increasing guard length
from shallow to deep.
The instruments immediately above and below the RTeX mandrel (typically
Acoustilog or Densilog above and Micro-laterolog below) become electrode A4
and provide the guards for the deeper diameter-of-investigation resistivity
measurement.  On the uphole side of the upper A4 electrode housing, and on the
downhole side of the lower A4 electrode housing, Isolation Subs are installed to
limit the A4 electrode size.  These Isolation Subs also separate the electrode A5
(upper and lower) from A4 and provide a means for the RTeX electronics to
make connection to the A5 electrode.  The particular Isolation Sub used for WTS
operation is the series 4485 XA (F131238000).
All electrodes on the RTeX mandrel are symmetrical around the center electrode
(A0) in number and size.  Each of the two A4, upper and lower, electrodes is
required to be 10 to 14 ft in length.  However, the upper A5 and lower A5 can be
quite different in length.
Additionally, electrodes A2 and A3 are bookended by small voltage-sense
electrodes.  The A1 electrode has one sense electrode (on the A2 electrode
side).
The RTeX housing is isolated with a layer of fiberglass and the electrodes are
placed on top of this layer.  The isolation between electrodes is a ring of rubber
at each electrode end and more fiberglass in between.
Electronic circuitry for the system is located inside the RTeX mandrel.

In summary:
•
RTeX provides four apparent resistivity curves with different diameters of
investigation (approximately 18”, 26”, 38” and 74”).
•
Based on the preliminary success of the Focus 1241 XA Rt Explorer, the intent of
this project was to quickly provide a WTS version.  The resulting hybrid
combination of the 1241 PA crossover adapter and the 1241 XB Rt Explorer was
the solution.  This hybrid combination is both mechanically and electrically
compatible with other WTS tools.
•
Environmental corrections can be applied to the apparent resistivity curves.
•
The measured data can be inverted in real-time to derive formation resistivity Rt,

1241XB-RTEX-AMO,Brief Description of Service .................................................. …………….. - 1.2 PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION..............................................................................4,"PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION

To illustrate the principle of operation of the Rt Explorer (RTeX), a block diagram
of the electrode array and interface electronics is shown in Figure 1.  Only half of
the array is shown in the block diagram.  Please remember that for each one of
the electrodes shown, i.e. M1, M2, A1 - A5, there is a corresponding M1’, M2’,
A1’ - A5’ electrode.
Electrodes A0, M1, M2, A1, A2, and A3, are located on the RTeX mandrel.  The
instruments above and below the mandrel become part of the electrode system
and are referred to as electrodes A4 and A5.  Keep in mind that the 1241 PA
placed on top of the mandrel makes up part of the upper A4 electrode.
Electrodes A5 must be isolated from the rest of the system using Isolation Subs.
Four sinusoidal sources, each at different frequencies ranging from 30 to 195 Hz,
are connected as indicated in the diagram.  Frequencies F1, F2, and F3 are
voltage sources and F4 is a current source.
A0 is the current measuring electrode.  The bucker amplifier injects sufficient
current through A0 into the formation to maintain the difference in potential
between M1 and M2 at zero for all four frequencies.  This prevents the I0 current
from flowing up or down the borehole, but rather is forced into the formation in a
“disk” shape, perpendicular to the instrument.  The voltage across the sensing
resistor is proportional to the I0 current.
Electrodes A1, A2, A3 and A4 provide guards of increasing length to electrode
A0.  At frequency F1 the guard is only A1; return for F1 is A2, A3 and A4.  At
frequency F2 the effective guard has increased in length, and is the combination
of A1 and A2 which focuses the frequency F2 currents deeper than the F1
currents.  Return for this mode is A3 and A4.  This pattern continues and the
guard for frequency F3 is the combined length of the A1, A2 and A3 electrodes
with the return being only A4.  Finally for frequency F4, the guard is A1, A2, A3
and A4 (with return being A5), providing the deepest measurement.  All four of
these frequencies are being emitted simultaneously to create the varying
diameters of investigation and are illustrated in Figure 2.
The voltage of electrode M1 combined with the current I0, both measured at the
four operating frequencies F1, F2, F3 and F4, provide the resistance seen by A0
under the respective focusing conditions and with increased diameter-of-
investigation from shallow to deep.  By applying the proper “k” factors, these
resistances are converted to resistivities at four diameters of investigation.
Normally a Micro-resistivity instrument, like the MLL, is connected below the
RTeX and becomes the lower A4 electrode guard.  The MLL provides an Rxo
measurement that is used for RTeX data processing and inversion.

The 1241 XB Rt Explorer (RTeX) is a galvanic resistivity tool with four diameters
of investigation.  Two measurements are required to determine resistivity: VM
and I0.  VM is a measurement of the voltage of the M1 electrode with respect to
surface remote, and I0 is the survey current entering/leaving electrode A0.  Both
signals are sampled by A/D’s on the preamp board and processed by the Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) on the Controller board.  If the tool only had to provide a
measurement for one diameter of investigation, there would be only one driver
operating at one frequency, and the resistivity could be determined simply by
examining the amplitudes of VM and I0.  However with four drivers operating at
different frequencies, the VM and I0 signals will each be a composite waveform
of four different sinusoids.  Now we can no longer just examine the amplitude of
the time-domain waveform.  Each waveform must first be decomposed into their
four constituent components.  The “decomposition” is done by performing a
Discrete-Fourier Transform (DFT) on the signals.  The DFT process provides the
amplitude and phase of the sinusoids comprising each waveform.  This
processing is performed downhole by the DSP, and the results are reported to
the surface for resistivity calculations.

The A/D sampling frequency is ~7.653kHz and the DFT is performed on sets of
512 samples.  To avoid spectral leakage, the four operating frequencies are
chosen to be integer multiples of a base frequency, 14.947 Hz.  These are
29.89 Hz (F4), 104.6 Hz (F1), 164.4 Hz (F3) and, 194.3 Hz (F2).  The operating
frequencies and A/D sampling frequency are derived from a common system
clock so they are precisely related to each other.

The DFT results from multiple cycles are stacked (or added) together.  The
stacked DFT results along with a stack count are reported in the subsets.  The
stack count indicates how many cycles were stacked in the DFT result.  An
averaged DFT result is determined by dividing the stacked results by the stack
count.  Typically, the time interval between “Acquire Subset” commands
determines how many cycles are stacked.  One cycle is 66.9ms (512 A/D
samples).  When the tool receives an “Acquire” command, it
(1) waits for the current cycle to complete,
(2) transfers the contents of the stacking buffer to a send buffer, and
(3) clears the stacking buffer to start a new stack.
The “Send subset” command starts transmission of data to the surface from the
send buffer.  The default maximum stacking level is 60.  If the maximum stacking
level is reached, the stacking buffer will be transferred to the send buffer and a
new stack will be started.

In addition to the frequency-domain data (DFT results), the underlying time-
domain waveforms are stacked as well.  The full waveforms, each being 512
samples long, can be uploaded in Subset 4.  The waveforms are made available
for debugging purposes only, that is, they are not needed for processing.

Only VM and I0 are needed to determine resistivity, but the voltage and current
of each driver are measured as well for control purposes.  The DSP implements
a control algorithm used to determine the optimum driver output levels.  The goal
of the algorithm is to operate the drivers at the highest achievable drive level
under varying borehole conditions.  Another goal of the algorithm is to maintain a
reasonable balance in the magnitude spectrum of the I0 signal so that one
spectral component does not over-power the measurement and compromise the
measurement of the other components.

The control algorithm periodically checks the measurements to see if they are all
within range.  If any waveform exceeds a high or low limit, the control algorithm
will incrementally decreases the driver output levels until all waveforms fall within
range.  VM and I0 are monitored to see if the signal levels are within the
measurement circuit’s input range.  The output current of the voltage sources are
monitored to ensure they are within design limits.  The output voltages of all the
power opamps are monitored to ensure their outputs are not clipping.

On power-up, the algorithm initializes all drive levels to a default value.
Afterwards, it examines I0 and determines the relative drive settings needed to
equalize the magnitudes of the four spectral components.  After determining the
relative drive settings, the algorithm searches for the maximum achievable drive
levels by incrementally increasing them until an out-of-range condition occurs on
any waveform.  Afterwards, the drive levels are reduced to bring all signals back
within range.  After finding the optimum drive levels, the control algorithm saves
the state of I0 for future comparison.  The algorithm may decide to search for a
new drive setting if a significant change occurs on I0.

The main operational subset is Subset 2.  This subset contains the frequency-
domain data for I0 and VM, which is needed to determine resistivity.  Additional
waveform data is reported as well for monitoring purposes.  Waveform data for
I0, VM, and the driver voltages and currents are reported.  In an effort to maintain
a reasonable subset size, only one waveform at a time is sent.  Each acquisition
sends a different waveform.  A wave ID parameter is included in the subset to
indicate which waveform was sent.  To further reduce the length of the subset,
the waveform is decimated to 128 samples."

The shallowest diameter-of-investigation is ~ 18 inches, that distance makes the
curve MLR1 sensitive to borehole ruggosity; to improve the response of the tool it
is recommended to centralize the tool for small borehole sizes.  But for big
borehole sizes this curve is going to read mainly mud even when the tool is
centralized.  For that reason, for boreholes greater than 8.5”, it is better to run the
tool with 1.5 inch Stand-Offs.  Do not run the tool FREE.

For the RTeX, the main purpose is to provide the description of the variation of
resistivity in invaded zones in salt saturated borehole fluids.
The RTeX interpretation uses the Rxo provided by the MLL in conjunction with
the four RTeX resistivities (MLR1, MLR2, MLR3, and MLR4) to produce a
corrected Rt and the length-of-invasion Lxo."
1241XB-RTEX-AMO,Brief Description of Service .................................................. …………….. - 1.6 RTEX DELIVERABLES........................................................................................9,"RTEX DELIVERABLES
Well site deliverables are the four apparent resistivities MLR1, MLR2, MLR3, and
MLR4 borehole corrected.  In addition to the normal environmental corrections
(through ENCOR program) a more advanced correction mechanism is available
for RTeX measurements.  The ABC (Adaptive Borehole Correction) processing
accounts for the tool position within the borehole beyond the two supposed
positions, centered and eccentered, that are available through ENCOR. The ABC
more properly corrects the curves for borehole effects and does not suffer from
the problem of over or under correcting that would be inherent in simple borehole
correction.  Additionally, the ABC utilizes data from all four curves simultaneously
and results inversion provides estimations of Rxo, Lxo, Rt and the tool
eccentricity within the borehole.  Normally MLL will be run in combination.  In this
case the MLL apparent resistivity will complement the four RTeX readings.
Please see RTeX log example in Figure 3.
The four MLR curves were designed to provide a clear indication of invasion.  To
accomplish this, diameter-of-investigation from very shallow (MLR1 ~ 18 inches)
to fairly deep (MLR4 ~ 74 inches) are required.  MLR1 is in particular helpful in
defining the invasion of relatively low resistivity encountered in a formation with
an oil-water contact.
Diameters-of-investigation for lateral tools are not fixed as they are for induction
type measurements, but are highly dependent on the contrast between the
formation resistivity and the resistivity of borehole fluid.  The diameter-of-
investigation becomes shallower as the contrast Rt/Rm increases.
The borehole correction also increases with the contrast Rt/Rm.  Furthermore,
borehole correction becomes greater as the instrument deviates from being
perfectly centered in the borehole.
RTeX borehole corrections are computed for two situations: (1) centered where
the tool is exactly in the center of the borehole, and (2) eccentered with 1.5”
standoff where the tool is on one side of the borehole wall and would be touching
the wall except for the standoffs.  The logs with centered tools would require less
correction than the eccentered ones for the same borehole size and Rt/Rm.

For large boreholes (12 ¼” bit size) and high contrast, the MLR1 borehole
correction becomes excessively large.  The uncertainty of the position of the
instrument, as well as the departure from the borehole being a cylinder of
constant diameter over the length of the instrument, precludes an accurate
correction.
For these reasons, MLR1 is displayed only when the borehole correction is such
that it preserves the accuracy of the final result.

DC POWER SUPPLIES
This mandrel electronics is powered from a downhole power converter in the
1241 PA that converts 180 VAC to a +28 volt power source.  This voltage is locally
supplied only to the 1241 XB through dedicated pins.  See additional information
on the 1241 PA Power Adapter in this manual.
In the block diagram of Figure 2, all power supplies are denoted as the block
labeled “Power Supplies.”  For a detailed description of the PC boards and circuitry
associated with this block, see POWER SUPPLY CIRCUITRY.
Before the +28 volts is applied to a power supply module, it passes through a
special circuit used to filter noise from other instruments hanging on this common
power source.  It is the output of these filters that is applied as an input to the
power supplies.  For more detail, see section 2.6.3 of this document.
This filtered +28 volts is reduced to ±5 volts using a DC-to-DC converter module
A3000558000.  This voltage source provides power wherever a bipolar 5 V supply
is required.  The converter module is located on a heat sink installed on the
chassis.  For more detail on this dual supply, see section 2.6.1 of this document.
This filtered +28 volts is also the source for five +3.3 volts converter modules
(A3000976000).  These supplies provide power to most of the remaining circuitry
in the instrument. They, too, are located on PC boards mounted to heat sinks.  For
more detail on this supply, see section 2.6.2 of this document."

2.2.1 TELEMETRY COMMUNICATIONS

The 1241 XB Rt Explorer responds to the WTS Telemetry protocol for
communication on the instrument bus.  It adheres to the tool interface
specification F059448000.

U9 is an Actel FPGA which contains a Manchester Decoder for decoding
commands on the instrument bus, and two Manchester Encoders.  One
encoder is dedicated for mode 2 data, and the other for modes 5 or 7.  The
FPGA also provides an interface to the temperature sensor and serial
EEPROM.  All internal registers are selected with /MS3.  The receiver
(U12) for mode 2 commands and drivers (U10, U11, U14) for mode 2, 5,
and 7 are shown on sheet 4.  The instrument bus transformers are located
on a separate PC board (A3000773000).

Data transfer between the DSP and mode 2 encoder/decoder is interrupt-
driven using IRQ1.  Interrupt line IRQ1 is shared between the mode 2
decoder and mode 2 encoder.  A status register within the FPGA indicates
the source of the interrupt.  This register is read by the DSP to determine
which device generated the interrupt.  The decoder asserts IRQ1 whenever
it receives a command that is addressed to the tool.  The interrupt notifies
the DSP to read the command from the receive buffer within the FPGA.
The mode 2 encoder can also be enabled to generate an interrupt using
/IRQ1.  When the DSP is ready to send data on mode 2, the encoder
interrupt is enabled.  Once enabled, the encoder asserts /IRQ1 whenever
the transmit buffer is empty and ready to accept new data.  The DSP writes
a new word to the encoder in response to the interrupt.  Figure 3 shows
the tool receiving a “Send Subset E” command and responding on Mode 2.

A second encoder is used to transmit data on either mode 5 or mode 7.
Writes to this encoder is DMA driven using /DMAR2 and /DMAG2.  The
DMA request line (/DMAR2) is asserted by the FPGA when the encoder is
ready to accept new data.  In response, the DSP asserts /DMAG2 and
presents data on the bus (D[31:16]).  The data is latched in the encoder
transmit buffer on the rising edge of /DMAG2.  Bus control signals /MS1
and /WR are not active during the DMA transfer.  Figure 4 shows the tool
transmitting Subset E on Mode 5.  The bottom half of the capture is a
zoomed-in view of the first DMA transaction.  A second transaction closely
follows because the transmit buffer becomes ready immediately after the
encoder latches the data and begins transmitting.  Subsequent
transactions are spaced 171µs apart.  The last pulse may or may not be
present, depending on whether or not the DSP responds to an internal
DMA interrupt in time to disable the DMA before the last word has been
latched by the encoder.
2.2.2 DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR

U4 is an Analog Devices digital-signal processor (DSP).  Instruction code
for the device is stored in Flash memory (U5).  The DSP features 4 Mbits of
internal memory for storage of program and data.  After a power-on, or
software reset, the code is loaded from flash into internal memory.

The DSP can be booted from either the upper or lower half of flash
memory.  By default, the DSP boots from the upper half since the boards
are shipped without JP1 installed.  If JP1 is installed, the DSP will boot
from the lower half.  If necessary, new firmware updates can be

downloaded using Benchmark software (A7000205 SW).  Updating the
firmware requires that the DSP re-program the flash memory.  If a problem
occurs during the download process and corrupts the boot memory, the
DSP can be re-booted from the backup copy in the lower half of flash
memory.

Much of the interfacing between the DSP and peripheral devices is done
through two Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), U9 and U16.  U16 is
an Actel FPGA which contains the logic to interface with the drivers and
A/D’s.  U9 contains the interface for the instrument bus, serial EPROM, and
temperature sensor.

A heartbeat LED (D6) blinks once every second.  This LED is a useful tool
to help determine if the DSP is operating correctly.

Header P3 is a connector for an in-circuit emulator and used for
development purposes only.
2.2.3 DATA ACQUISITION

The output voltage and output current of each driver, as well as the output
voltage of the Bucker board, are measured and gathered as data in the
overall scheme of this instrument.  The chore of gathering the data and
sending it to the surface is one of the functions of the DSP.  Measurement
circuits are found on sheets 10 and 11.  Sheet 10 contains the four A/D
channels used to measure the output current of each driver.  Sheet 11
contains five A/D channels to the output voltage of the four drivers and the
bucker.

The following description starts at the top-right corner of sheet 10 to trace
the signal path of the mode 1 driver’s current measurement.  U38 is an
instrumentation amplifier used to measure the differential voltage across a
current sense resistor mounted on the chassis.  R177 sets the gain at
5 V/V.  Input over-voltage protection is provided by R175 and R176 and
clamping diodes D16.  After the instrumentation amplifier, the signal is
level-shifted and lightly filtered by opamp U123.  A 1.25 V offset is added to
center the signal within the 2.5 V input range of the A/D converter.  U55 is a
16-bit A/D converter.

Other A/D channels are similar to the previously described channel.
However, there are some differences in the first stage.  The mode 1, 2, and
3 driver voltages are measured without the aid of an instrument amplifier.

The reference voltage for the analog section is provided by U36.  It
generates a 2.5 V reference voltage.  A voltage divider (R147 and R156) is
used to derive a 1.25 V reference needed by the DDS chips.  U121 A buffers
the 2.5 V reference to provide a low impedance reference for the A/D’s.  A

An A/D conversion is initiated by a rising edge on the CNV input (pin 6).
The CNV input of all the A/D’s are driven by the A/D sampling clock
(/MLL_AD_CLK) which is generated by FPGA U16.  The A/D sampling
clock is an inverted pulse generated every 130.7µs.  The A/D’s have a
serial interface consisting of a serial clock (SCK), serial data out (SDO),
and serial data in (SDI).  The A/D’s are daisy-chained by connecting the
SDO of one device to the SDI of another.  This configuration allows U16 to
read all A/D’s, using only one data line, in one long serial bit stream.  FPGA
U16 drives SCK and shifts in data from the SDO of U79.  SCK is a
discontinuous clock operating at 12 MHz.

The A/D timing is illustrated below in Figure 5.  After the FPGA pulses
/MLL_AD_CLK to initiate a conversion, it waits 4.6µs after the rising edge
to allow the A/D’s to finish the conversion.  After waiting for the conversion
to complete, the FPGA drives SCK for 160 cycles to shift out the new A/D
data.

The most involving task of the FPGA (U16) is to collect the A/D samples
and deliver them to the DSP.  Data from the A/D’s located on the Controller
board, as well as the A/D data from the Preamp board, are collected and
written to a FIFO for the DSP to read.  A block diagram of the data path is

FPGA.  The DMA (direct memory access) controller allows data to be read
from the FPGA without the direct involvement of the core processor,
freeing it to do more meaningful work.  DMA transfers occur through the
use of two handshaking signals: /DMAR1 (dma request) and /DMAG1 (dma
grant).  The FPGA asserts /DMAR1 whenever there is data available in the
FIFO.  In response, the DSP asserts /DMAG1 while reading one word from
the FIFO in the FPGA.  Although the data bus (D[31:16]) is used to transfer
data, the memory-select (/MS2) and read (/RD) signals are not active
during the DMA read operation.  See diagram of Figure 7.

The FIFO is 16 bits wide.  Each A/D sample generates two writes to the
FIFO – one for the most-significant word and one for the least significant
word.  For the case of the 16-bit onboard A/D’s, the most-significant word is
0000h.  For the 18-bit A/D’s on the Preamp, the most-significant word
includes the upper two bits of the A/D value; unused bit positions are zero-
filled.
clock (point A).  After waiting 4.6μs, the FPGA starts shifting in data from
the onboard A/D’s (point B).  Shortly thereafter, the Preamp starts sending
A/D data as well (point C).  The FPGA latches each Preamp word on the
rising edge of RFS and immediately writes the word into the FIFO.  A DMA
request occurs as a result of each FIFO write operation (point D).
The data collected from the onboard A/D’s is not written into the FIFO until
the following sampling clock.  After shifting in the serial data, the FPGA
holds the data in the shift-register until the falling edge of the next sampling
clock.  The DMA requests resulting from the FIFO write operations can be
seen at point E.


The FPGA counts the number of words returned by the Preamp board.  If
the FPGA does not receive enough data from the Preamp board by the end
of the cycle, it will write zeroes into the FIFO in lieu of the missing words.
On the other hand, if it receives too many words, it will inhibit writing the
extra words into the FIFO.  These measures are taken to ensure the
coherency of the data.  The DSP expects a certain number of words each
cycle.  Missing or extra words will cause the processing to become

2.2.4 ELECTRODE DRIVERS

Reference Signals
Four identical circuits are used to create a sinusoidal reference signal for
each driver.  These circuits can be found on the top half of sheets 6, 7, 8,
and 9.  These circuits are physically identical to each other but they each
generate a different frequency.  Refer to page 6 of the schematic for the
following discussion of the reference signal generated for the mode 1
driver.
The signal chain begins with U21 which is a DDS chip used to generate a
105 Hz sine wave.  The frequency and phase of the sine wave is
programmed by the DSP during startup.  Pin 14 is the sine wave output.
The waveform at this point is unipolar, ranging from 0 to approximately
800mV.
This unipolar sine wave is ac-coupled by C311 and R245 to remove the DC
offset and create a bipolar waveform.  U102 A buffers the signal.  U102 B
and its surrounding components form a 2nd order low-pass filter needed to
remove quantization noise.  The signal at TP59 is a clean sine wave,
centered at 0 V, with an amplitude of 400mV.  Afterwards, the signal passes
through a programmable attenuator.
The programmable attenuator is formed by multiplexer U25 and
surrounding resistors.  R72 is the bottom resistor of a voltage divider, and
the top resistor is selectable through U25.  The 8-to-1 mux allows for 8
levels of attenuation ranging from 1/1 to 1/128.  The attenuation settings
were chosen so that they vary by a factor of 2.  U102 C buffers the signal
after the attenuation stage.  Afterwards, the signal is ac-coupled with C334
and R235 to remove any DC offset that may be added by the previous
stages.  U102 D buffers the signal again to drive transformer T5.
U101 is a comparator used to detect the zero crossing point of the
reference signal.  The comparator output feeds back into an FPGA (U16),
which waits for a rising edge on SQUARE_WAVE_F1 before updating the
mux enable (MUX_EN_F1) or mux select signals (MUX_A2_F1,
MUX_A1_F1, MUX_A0_F1).  This feature is included to minimize abrupt
changes in the reference signal when switching attenuation settings.  A
simplified sketch of the logic is shown below in Figure 9.  The DSP writes
the attenuation setting to a control register, but the new settings do not take
effect until a rising edge occurs at the comparator output.  A light RC filter

the DDS chips.  The SPORT1 I/O signals consist of TCLK1, TFS1, DT1,
RFS1, and DR1.  These signals connect to the FPGA.  Although
connected, RFS1 and DR1 are not used - they are held high by the FPGA.
The FPGA passes serial clock (TCLK1) and data (DT1) through to the DDS
chips on TCLK_SYN and DT_SYN, respectively.  The frame sync (TFS1) is
gated to allow the DSP to selectively write to the DDS chips.  The DSP
enables the individual DDS frame sync lines through a memory-mapped
control register.  The logic is illustrated in Figure 10.

Voltage Sources

voltage sources used to drive the guard electrodes.  The following

discussion describes the operation of the mode 1 driver circuit shown on
page 6.  The other drivers on pages 7 and 8 operate in a similar manner.
The output transformer and current sense resistor for the driver are
mounted on the chassis.  A simplified schematic of the entire driver is
shown in Figure 11 below.  The function of the circuit is to impose a
reference signal, presented on the primary winding of T5, across the A2*
and A1* sense electrodes.  The sense electrodes can be thought of as
remote sense terminals that allow the voltage directly at the “load” to be
regulated.  The “load” in this case is the mud (or borehole fluid), which is
driven by electrodes A2 and A1.  Rather than sensing directly at the drive
electrodes, where IR drops and contact impedances can affect the
regulation, separate sense electrodes are used instead.  The sense
electrodes are located close to their respective drive electrodes on the
housing.

When discussing the operation of the driver in qualitative terms, it helps to
separate the discussion into an AC analysis and DC analysis.  For AC
analysis, capacitors C331 and C337 are considered to be shorts and
resistors R294 and R295 are neglected because their impedance is much
greater than the impedance of the capacitors.  For DC analysis, the
capacitors are open and the effects of the resistors are considered.  At
0.159 Hz, the impedance of the capacitors equals the impedance of the
resistors.  At frequencies above 0.159 Hz, the effects of the capacitors
dominate and the resistors can be ignored.  This is especially true at the
four operating frequency of the drivers (30 Hz, 105 Hz, 165 Hz, and 195 Hz.),
which is much greater than 0.159 Hz.


T5 is a 1:1 transformer that is used to translate the reference signal, which
is referenced to ground, into a floating source that can be used to drive the
(+) input of U31 with respect to the A1* sense.  Because of negative
feedback, the opamp adjusts its output to whatever voltage necessary to
make the voltage at the (-) input equal to that of the (+) input.  A 6:1 step-

down transformer (TF1) is used to couple the output to the electrodes.  TF1
boosts the output current, which reduces the amount of current that needs
to be supplied by U31 and the power supplies.  R3 is a resistor used for
measuring the driver’s output current.

Resistors R294 and R295 are needed to provide DC feedback for the
opamp.  These resistors provide a path for input bias currents and
establish the DC operating point of the opamp.  The opamp needs to be
biased so that its output rests at 0 V.  The DC offset at the output of the
opamp needs to be controlled because the transformer winding presents a
low resistance DC path to ground.

Before proceeding any farther, it should be mentioned that the driver looks
at the average voltage of the sense electrodes.  For the sake of simplicity,
the circuit illustrated in Figure 11 only presents the upper electrode array.
Rather than just looking at A2*, the positive sense is taken to be the
average voltage of the A2* and A2’* electrode.  The averaging is performed
by R221 and R223.  These resistors can be found on sheet 2 of the

Again on sheet 6, U31 is a power opamp capable of driving high currents.
The output current limit is set by R94.  With 15.4kΩ for R94, the current
limit is set at 750mA.  An enable pin (pin 8) is provided to allow the opamp
to be disabled --- this places the output in a high-impedance state.
Disabling occurs by pulling pin 8 to the negative supply rail.  It is the task of
the DSP to disable the opamp while the tool is in the CAL or ZERO mode.
The enable pin of all three power opamps used for the voltage sources are
controlled by the same signal (VDRV_EN).  An RC snubber (R285 and
C354) is attached to the output to suppress high-frequency oscillations that
may occur due to instability in the opamp’s output stage.

Note:
The schematic symbol indicates that the part has 48 pins.  In
reality, there are only 20 pins, which are shown on U31-1.  Pin 21 through
48 were added to the schematic symbol so that thermal vias could be
included in the footprint for heat sinking purposes.



Current Source
The deep driver is a 30 Hz current source used to drive the A5 electrode.
The return is connected to electrode A4.  The deep driver is shown on the
bottom half of sheet 9 of the schematic.

The driver circuit is located at the bottom half of sheet 9 --- a simplified
forced across R311.  The value of R311 sets the transconductance of the

return can be connected to A4.  Notice that this circuit uses AGND1 and
±3.3 VA1, whereas the voltage sources use AGND and ±3.3 VA.  Only the
current source uses the ±3.3 VA1 power supply.  The voltage sources and
other analog circuits use the ±3.3 VA supplies.
2.2.5 PREAMP INTERFACE

All signals between the Controller and Preamp boards are transmitted
differentially.  U15, U97, and U17 are LVDS2 receivers and drivers used to
interface to the Preamp board.  The receive port (RCLK_B, DR_B, RFS_B)
feed into FPGA U16 so that the A/D samples can be collected and written
to FIFO.  Commands are sent to the Preamp board through the transmit
port (TCLK0, TFS0, DT0) which are directly driven by the DSP’s serial port.
The system clock (MAIN_CLK) and A/D sampling clock (/MLL_AD_CLK)
are provided by FPGA U16.
2.2.6 CAL/VER

A calibration signal and an internal resistor network are included for
diagnostic purposes.  Refer to sheet 12 of the schematic and the simplified
version of Figure 13.

is used to generate a calibration signal for the Preamp.  The CAL signal is

created by adding the individual reference signals to create a composite
waveform consisting of four tones.  Opamp U91 B is used to generate a
complement so that the signal can be sent differentially to the Preamp
board.  The output is passed through analog switches (U94) so that the
signal can be disabled when not in use.

(assuming a k-factor of 1).  Relays K1, K2, and K3 are used to connect the
resistor network to the drivers’ output.  Analog switches (U90 and U94) are
used to connect the drivers’ sense lines to the resistor network.  A

2.2.7 MISCELLANEOUS

Several items on the Controller board have not been covered.  They are
discussed below.

Housing potential: U134 forms a unity-gain buffer used to drive the inner
housing at system common.  The input is taken from the Bucker board’s
common, and the output drives a contact assembly [A3001017000] located
on the chassis.

FPGA power: U1, Q1, and surrounding components form a 2.5 V regulator
to provide the core voltage for the two FPGA’s.


FPGA U9 Functions:

Memory: The FPGA also interfaces to the serial EEPROM (U8).  The
EEPROM is used to store hardware information and calibration tables.
Instead of using a hardware assisted SPI interface, the DSP directly
manipulates the EEPROM signals through a control register.

Glue logic: Glue logic for the flash memory (U5) chip-enable signal is
implemented in the FPGA.  The boot-memory select (/BMS) and
memory-select (/MS0) from the DSP are AND’ed together to generate
/FLS_CE.  On power-up, the DSP initially uses /BMS to load
instructions from flash memory.  After the initial boot process, /MS0 is
used to select the flash memory.  The flash write enable (/FLS_WE) is
generated by OR’ing the /MS0 and /WR signals.

DSP clock: The FPGA also contains a PLL that is used to generate a
32 MHz clock (DSP_CLK) for the DSP.

Temperature Sensor:  FPGA U9 also contains a serial interface for the
temperature sensor (U7).  The serial clock (TEMP_SCLK) runs at
12 MHz.  The FPGA reads the temperature sensor every 0.5 second
and generates an interrupt on /IRQ0.  In response, the DSP reads the
temperature from the FPGA; see timing diagram of Figure 14.

2.3.1 INTRODUCTION
The Preamp board (A3000644000) contains the signal conditioning and
A/D converters for measuring VM and I0 --- which are the two values
necessary to calculate resistivity.  The Preamp board is responsible for
sampling the VM and I0 signals and sending the A/D samples to the
Controller board (A3000643000).  Each signal is simultaneously measured
with three different gains to increase the dynamic range of the
measurements.  Two-way communication between the Preamp and
Controller is achieved with two synchronous serial ports; each consisting of
a clock, frame sync, and data line.  All signals between the Preamp and
Controller are transmitted and received differentially using LVDS drivers
and receivers.
2.3.2 I0 MEASUREMENT CIRCUITS
I0 current is measured by sensing the voltage across a 2Ω resistor located
on the Bucker board.  Starting at page 2 of the Preamp schematic
(A3000644 SCH), the I0 signal enters the board on pins 4 and 14 of
connector J3.  Resistors R82 and R84, along with diodes D5, form a clamp
to help protect the input from any damaging voltages that may be present
on the A0 electrode --- signal is denoted by A0_I+ and A0_I–.

On page 6 of the schematic, the signal then feeds into a dual, four-input
multiplexer (U21).  The multiplexer is used to select between LOG,
VERIFY, CAL, and ZERO inputs (signal is now CH0+ and CH0–).

Since the I0 measurement has a large amount of gain, it is important to
remove any DC offset in the signal.  The signal ultimately arrives on page
4, where the output of U21 feeds into an AC-coupling network formed by
capacitors C25 & C26, and resistors R108 & R109 to remove this DC
offset.

I0, at this point, is amplified with three different gains.  Three parallel signal
conditioning paths, are similar with the exception of having different gains,
are shown on page 4.  The following description will trace the signal chain
through the highest gain channel which begins with U46.  Keep in mind that
the same action is occurring in the two other chains.

U46 is an instrumentation amplifier which amplifies the differential voltage
at its input and produces an output voltage referenced to ground.  The gain
of the device is determined by the value of R110.  With R110 at 49.9Ω, the
gain of U46 is 991 V/V.  R111 and C110 form another ac-coupling stage

An additional gain of 4.01 V/V is provided by the non-inverting gain stage
formed by U57 B.  Afterwards, the signal is scaled and level-shifted by
U57 A.  This stage attenuates the signal by a factor of 2, and applies a 2.5 V
offset.  At the output of U57 A, the signal will appear as a smaller, inverted
waveform centered at 2.5 V.

U57 D and its associated components form a Sallen-Key low-pass filter.
The Sallen-Key circuit, along with the pole introduced by capacitor C149,
forms a 3rd order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 4kHz cutoff frequency.

The low-gain channel begins with U22 and has a gain of 10.9 V/V.  The
medium-gain channel begins with U32 and has a gain of 100 V/V.  The low
and medium gain channels are similar to the high gain channel except that
no additional gain is applied after the instrumentation amplifier.  U55 B and
U59 B are simply used as unity gain buffers in their respective circuits.

The low, medium, and high gain channels are successively sampled using
only one A/D converter.  U26 is a multiplexer used to switch the A/D input
between the outputs of the three channels.  A sampling clock, provided by
the Controller board, initiates three different A/D conversions – one for
each gain channel.  The three channels are sampled in quick succession,
only 6µs apart from each other.  Dual op amp U47 converts the single-
ended input signal into a differential signal (AD2 IN+ and AD2 IN–) that can
be sampled by the A/D converter.

U27 is an 18-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter.  A
conversion is initiated by the falling edge on the /CNVST input (pin 35).
This edge causes the A/D to sample the input and begin the conversion
process which takes approximately 1.25µs.  While converting, the A/D
holds its BUSY pin (29) high.  When finished converting, the A/D brings the
BUSY pin low to indicate new data is available to be read.

A serial interface is used to read the A/D.  When reading data, the chip-
select (/CS) pin (32) is pulled low to enable the serial interface.  Data is
shifted out on the SDOUT pin (21) on the rising edge of the serial clock
provided on the SCLK pin (22).

The 2.5 V reference voltage needed by the A/D is externally supplied by
U17.  The A/D internally amplifies the supplied reference to create a
4.096 V reference for conversions.  The internally generated 4.096 V
reference is routed to pin 37 and decoupled by C136.
2.3.3 VM MEASUREMENT CIRCUITS
Two electrodes surround the A0 electrode – M1 and M1’.  These two
electrodes are averaged and buffered by the Bucker board
(A3001215000).  The buffered signal (M1) is fed into the Preamp board on

1241 XB Hybrid RTeX  –  Circuit Description
131067-945 / 1241 XB
AUG 2009

Also seen on page 2 is the surface remote signal (REMOTE).  It enters the
board on pin 16 of connector P3.  The surface remote signal is filtered by a
3rd order Butterworth low-pass filter formed by op amp U48 A and U48 B ---
refer to page 6.  The -3db frequency is 9kHz.  Filtering is performed to
remove any telemetry signals that may be present on wireline conductor 7.

The REMOTE signal then feeds into a dual, four-input multiplexer (U11).
The multiplexer is used to select between LOG, VERIFY, CAL, and ZERO
inputs (signal is now CH1+ and CH1–).  The signal ultimately arrives on
page 5, where the output of U11 feeds into an AC-coupling network formed
by capacitors C17 & C18, and resistors R86 & R87.  These components
remove any DC offset in the signal.

The VM measurement circuit on page 5 is identical to the previously
described I0 circuit on page 4 with the exception of some resistor values.
Although three gain channels are available at the present time, only the
low-gain channel, which begins with U9, is used.  The front-end
instrumentation amplifiers (U12 and U44) for the medium and high-gain
channels are set to a gain of 1 V/V, because higher gains caused the
amplifiers to saturate and adversely affect the low-gain channel
measurement.  Although the A/D actively samples the medium and high-
gain channels, calculations do not utilize these channels.

The two A/D’s, U27 (for I0) and U18 (for VM), are daisy-chained so that the
FPGA can read both A/D’s using one data line.  The serial data output of
U18 (pin 21) feeds into the serial data input of U27 (pin 16).  The FPGA
shifts in data from the serial data output of U27.  In this manner, the FPGA
can read both A/D’s in one 36-bit long bit-stream --- U27 data first, followed
by U18 data.
2.3.4 A/D DATA RETRIEVAL
The sampling clock (/MLL_AD_CLK), provided by the Controller board,
initiates the conversion process for the A/D’s.  The differential clock inputs
enter the Preamp board on pins 23 and 11 of connector P2.  At U34, a
differential driver, it is converted into standard logic levels and routed to the
FPGA (page 3).

Refer to the timing diagram of Figure 15.  At point A, after the rising edge
of /MLL_AD_CLK, the FPGA (U29) collects three samples from each A/D
converter.  The AD_CNVST signal is pulsed low (point B) to initiate each of
the three A/D conversions.  On the falling edge of AD_CNVST, the A/D’s
sample their inputs and bring their respective busy lines high (point C).
The FPGA monitors both busy lines and waits for them to go low before
reading the results from the A/D’s.  After the busy lines go low, the FPGA

1241 XB Hybrid RTeX  –  Circuit Description
131067-945 / 1241 XB
AUG 2009
Baker Atlas

In addition to reading the conversion results after the busy lines go low, the
FPGA also updates the mux select lines for U26 and U16 to select the next
gain channel in preparation for the next conversion.  The gain channels are
consecutively sampled 6µs apart in the following order: low, medium, high -
-- see Figure 15.



samples are being transferred to the Controller board.  Refer to the timing
clock pulse before sending them to the Controller board.  To do this, the
FPGA transfers the contents of a shift register into the transmit buffers on
the falling edge (point E) of the sampling clock.  Thereafter, it waits 10µs
before sending the samples.  The samples are sent to the Controller board
through a synchronous serial link consisting of RCLK, RFS, and DR.
RCLK is a serial clock running at 24 MHz.  RFS is a frame sync which goes
low when data is driven out on the data line, DR.  Figure 16 illustrates the
serial port in relation to the sampling clock.

The Preamp board sends twelve words instead of six.  The extra six words
are due to the fact that the FPGA was originally designed for a board which
had more channels.  Zeroes are transmitted in place of the channels that

1241 XB Hybrid RTeX  –  Circuit Description
131067-945 / 1241 XB
AUG 2009
Baker Atlas

The Preamp board can receive commands from the Controller board for
performing specific tasks.  This communication occurs through another
synchronous serial link consisting of TCLK, TFS, and DT.

TCLK operates at 12 MHz.  TFS is the frame sync and DT is the data line.
A command word is 16 bits long.  The Controller sends commands to…
1) enable the acquisition,
2) select the operating mode (LOG, VERIFY, CAL, or ZERO),
3) select the attenuation level for the cal signal, or
4) tell the Preamp to return a status word.
Differential signals from the Controller arrive at connector P2.  Clock
signals are found on pins 2 and 15; frame syncs are found on pins 3 and
16, and the data lines are pins 4 and 17.  These signals find their way to
U20, a LVDS chip (page 3).  U20 converts them into standard logic levels
useable by the FPGA, U29.
2.3.6 CALIBRATION CIRCUIT
A calibration signal (DRV_CAL±) is provided by the Controller board.  This
signal arrives at the Preamp board via connector P3 pins 19 and 10.  The
signal is a composite waveform created by summing four sinusoids with
frequencies of 30 Hz, 105 Hz, 165 Hz, and 195 Hz.  The calibration signal,
observed at the output of U9 while in the CAL mode, is shown below in
resistance is calculated by dividing the VM and I0 measurements.  Hence,

any common gain error between the two channels will be divided out.  The
VM low-gain channel is used as the reference for calibration.  The gain and
phase of the low, medium, and high gain I0 channels are determined with
respect to the low-gain VM channel.


be applied to the calibration signal, depending on the gain of the channel
being calibrated.  The full cal signal is applied when calibrating the low-gain
VM channel.
When calibrating the I0 channels which have more gain, the cal signal has
to be attenuated to a level within the input range of the channel.  The low-
gain I0 channel is calibrated with the 1/21 attenuation.  The medium and
high-gain I0 channels are calibrated with 1/201 and 1/2001 attenuation,
respectively.  Attenuation levels are selected by U41, a dual 4-to-1 mux.
The Controller board selects the attenuation level by programming the
appropriate bits of a control register in the FPGA.  The enable input of the
calibration mux allows the mux output to be tri-stated when the tool is not in
the CAL mode.  This feature helps reduce any potential cross-talk.

Multiplexers (U21 and U11) at the front end of the measurement channels
provide support for the various tool operating modes: LOG, VERIFY, CAL,
and ZERO.  The Controller sets the operating mode by programming the
mode control bits in the FPGA’s control register.  The mode control bits
drive the mux select lines A_CAL_GAIN_SEL0 and A_CAL_GAIN_SEL1.
In the CAL mode, both VM and I0 measure the cal signal.
In the ZERO mode, the inputs of each channel are shorted together.
Resistors R145 and R146 allow the inputs to be tied to common, but they

The LOG and VERIFY inputs for the I0 channel are the same.  In both
cases, the I0 channel measures the voltage across a 2Ω resistor on the
Bucker board.  For the VM channel, M1 is applied to the positive input in
both the LOG and VERIFY modes.  Surface remote is applied to the
negative input in the LOG mode, while in the VERIFY mode, the A5 node
of the verify network is applied to the negative input.
2.3.7 FPGA AND SUPPORT CIRCUITRY
On page 3 of the schematic is an Actel field programmable gate array
(FPGA), U29.
Among its functions are…
•
It contains the logic for collecting the A/D samples and sending them
to the Controller board.
•
It also contains a control register through which the Controller board
can set the operating mode (LOG, VERIFY, CAL, ZERO) and
attenuation setting of the calibration signal.
•
The system clock is obtained from MAIN_CLK because there is no
local oscillator on the board.
•
The FPGA is programmed to blink LED D9 once a second.  This may
be helpful in determining if the FPGA is functioning.

FPGA support features…
•
Connector P1: is a programming header used for programming the
FPGA.  It is intended for engineering use only.
•
Power Supply: the 2.5 V supply needed for the FPGA’s core is
provided by a low-dropout regulator formed by U35 and Q2 found on
page 2 of the schematic.  The 2.5 V reference is derived from the 3.3 V
supply using a voltage divider – R53 and R54.  Through feedback,
opamp U35 adjusts the base voltage of Q2 so that the voltage at its
non-inverting input equals the reference voltage presented at the
inverting input.  To prevent this supply from exceeding 3.3 V,
protection diode D18 is installed.
•
Isolation: the analog and digital sections of the board are isolated
from each other.  All signals between the FPGA and analog section
are isolated by U51, U52, U53, and U54.  These IC’s are digital
isolators that magnetically couple digital signals from one side to the
other.

LVDS: all signals between the Preamp and Controller are transmitted and
received differentially using LVDS drivers and receivers (U20, U34, and
U30).  Low-voltage differential signaling is a standard allowing for high data
rates with low power and low EMI.  The receivers detect differential signals
and convert them to standard logic.  Each receiver has a 100Ω termination
resistor across the input.  The differential voltage is typically only ±310mV.

1241XB-RTEX-AMO,1241XB Circuit Description ................................................. …………….. - 2.4 BUCKER BOARD .......................................................................................... 28,"BUCKER BOARD

Refer to the schematic diagram (A3001215 SCH) of the Bucker board
(A3001215000) for the following description.

Survey current must enter/leave the A0 electrode horizontally into the formation
rather than vertically through the mud to obtain a formation resistivity
measurement.  This objective is achieved by minimizing the potential difference
between the M2 and M1 electrodes.  The Bucker board contains a high-gain
amplifier used to adjust this potential difference.  With negative feedback, and
assuming infinite gain, the Bucker amplifier forces the potential difference between
M2 and M1 to zero.

There are actually two sets of electrodes; M2 (P1-18) and M1 (P1-5) in the upper
array, and their complements M2' (P1-20) and M1' (P1-7) in the bottom array.  As
a result, the Bucker board amplifies the difference between the average voltages
of these two sets of electrodes.  RN1 and RN2 are precision matched resistors
used to determine the average voltage of M1 and M1' (IN+) and the average
voltage of M2 and M2' (IN–), respectively.  The average of M1 and M1' is buffered
by U5 A and routed off board (P1-9) so that it can be measured by the Preamp
board.  U5 B buffers the average of M2 and M2' but its output is not used.  Its sole
purpose is to balance any loading U5 A may have on the M1/M1' input.

The overall frequency response of the Bucker is shaped to provide a high gain
within the frequency range of interest: 30 Hz to 195 Hz.  The gain is reduced at
frequencies outside of this region.  The overall gain is distributed among three
stages:
1) front-end instrumentation amplifier U1,
2) inverting amplifier formed by U2 B, and
3) a non-inverting amplifier formed by U2 A.

The first stage of amplification is U1.  It is an instrumentation amplifier which
provides a gain of 10 V/V.  The gain of this amplifier is determined by the value of
R5.
The output of U1 is AC-coupled to an inverting amplifier formed by U2 B.  The ratio
of R10 and R9 sets the passband gain of this stage to approximately 52.5 V/V.
The gain of this stage rolls off at frequencies above 214 Hz (F-3dB), as determined
by the values of C8 and R10.
U2 A forms a non-inverting gain stage.  Because of C5, the DC gain is limited to
1 V/V.  The value of R4 and R6 determine the passband gain, which is
approximately 16 V/V.  The gain of this stage also rolls off at frequencies above
214 Hz (F-3dB), as determined by the values of C7 and R4.

Finally, U3 is a power opamp with a high current output.  The output current limit is
programmable and set by resistor R14.  With R14 chosen to be 46.4kΩ, the
current limit is set at 250mA.  R8 is a precision current-sense resistor used to

measure the output current of the Bucker circuit.  The resistor has 4 terminals for a
“four-wire” measurement.  The sense terminals are routed off-board so that the
survey current (I0) can be measured by the Preamp board.  R8 is enclosed within
the feedback loop of U3 so that the output voltage is not affected by the IR drop
through the sense resistor.

Note:  The schematic symbol indicates that the part has 48 pins.  In reality, there
are only 20 pins, which are shown on U31-1.  Pin 21 through 48 (labeled
U3-2) were added to the schematic symbol so that thermal vias could be
included in the footprint for heat dissipation.

Power amplifier U3 cannot be powered directly from the +5 V supply that powers
the other active circuit components of this board.  Due to its limited supply voltage
rating, U3 has ±2.75 V provided to it by separate voltage regulators.  The +2.75 V
regulator is formed by U7 A, Q1, and surrounding components.  The +2.75 V
reference is derived from the +5 V supply using a voltage divider – R27 and R28.
Through feedback, opamp U7 A adjusts the base voltage of Q1 so that the voltage
at its non-inverting input equals the reference voltage presented at the inverting
input.

A similar circuit is provided for the –2.75 V regulator.  It is formed by U7 B, Q2, and
surrounding components.  Its operation is similar to the +2.75 V regulator.

Relays K1 and K2 are provided to support the VERIFY mode.  In the VERIFY
mode, the Bucker’s inputs and output are redirected to connect to an internal
resistor network on the Controller board (A3000643000) instead of the electrodes.

2.5.1 OTHER PC BOARDS
Several other PC boards of relative insignificance reside in the 1241 XB.
Two of these boards are nothing more than tie points where wires attach
and make assembly/disassembly/repair easier.  The first one of these
(A3000877000) is at the uphole end of the instrument.  It is shown on the
The second one is located between the chassis-mounted transformers and
the Controller board; it is the Signal Distribution board, SDB,
(A3000755000).  Wires from this board connect the electrodes (contact
blocks) and from the Main Controller board.
Just to the downhole side of the Controller board is a small PC board
(A3000773000) containing the four signal transformers used for WTS bus
communications.  Although requiring more wire terminations, this board
relieves the Controller board from mounting these relatively bulky and
heavy items from the board containing sensitive electronics (vibration
issues).
A final set of two boards (A3001788000) are mounted on the fiberglass rod
assembly.  The main purpose of these boards is to control the path of
wiring to the monitor electrode (M1, M2, M1’, M2’) sockets.  Due to the
sensitive nature of the monitor electrodes to interference, a well-defined
route is required.  The PC boards were put in place to provide a clean
junction for the shielded twisted pairs and the socket leads.
2.5.2 CHASSIS TRANSFORMERS
Three step-down transformers are mounted on the chassis between the
upper power supplies and the Signal Distribution board.  They provide a
current boost for the voltage drivers, VF1, VF2 and VF3.  The wires from
the transformers connect to their related chassis components using chassis
terminals.  By boosting the output current by a 6 to 1 ratio, less current is
needed by the driver opamp and the power supplies.
2.5.3 CONTACTS
Electrical contact is made from the outside world (each electrode) to the
internal circuits by means of 22 special feedthrough pins.  The larger
diameter portion of this pin is threaded, and screws into the electrode to
make contact with it.  The narrower section is rounded on the end to fit into
a receptacle.  In between these two sections is an isolating section.  A

ceramic coating is sprayed on this section to insulate the pin from
accidentally shorting out to the housing as it passes through to the interior
contact block.
The receptacles or contact blocks, as mentioned earlier, are free-floating in
cavities of the fiberglass rod assembly.  Being magnetically coupled to
magnets mounted in the rod such that they attract, the contact blocks are
free to slide up/down inside their slot.  This movement not only allows the
block to automatically align with the pin (upon insertion), but also relieves
any stresses that occur during thermal expansion.
2.5.4 TOP/BOTTOM CONNECTORS
The top connector, J1, of the 1241 XB is a standard 27-socket Focus
connector.  Should it be required, replacement of this connector is made
easily, because all wires coming from it terminate at the uphole terminal
board, TB1.
The bottom connector, J9, is a standard 32-socket WTS connector.
However, it is augmented with a bottom sub and a 32-pin WTS bulkhead

There is only one dual polarity power supply (PS6); its output is ±5 volts.
The ±5 V Power Supply (A3000558000) supplies a regulated output voltage
of ±5.0 Vdc at 0.5 Amp load current, per output, from an input voltage of 18
Vdc to 36 Vdc; 28 Vdc is typical.

kHz and employs a single-transistor discontinuous-mode flyback topology.
Operation is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) IC that controls
chopping (switching) of the 28 Vdc input voltage at a fixed frequency (300
kHz).  Each switching cycle is subdivided into three operating intervals:
conduction, flyback, and dead time.
Current flows in the primary of the flyback transformer and magnetic
energy is stored in the transformer’s air gap during the conduction interval.
The power supplies’ output capacitors maintain the output voltage.
When the conduction interval terminates, stored magnetic energy is
released to the secondary of the transformer and the power supplies’
output capacitors are charged.  The supply is designed such that the

The dead time interval commences when all stored magnetic energy is
depleted. Again the output capacitors maintain the output voltage.  The
dead-time interval ends on the rising edge of the next PWM clock, which
also marks the start of the next conduction interval.
For the following equation it can be seen that as Vin and/or Io change, the
PWM re-adjusts ton to maintain a constant Vo.

Io is the ±5.0 Vdc output current

Lp is the Flyback transformer's primary inductance

Output voltage sensing or error detection compares the output voltage to a
stable reference voltage and a resulting error voltage is created on the
secondary side.  Magnetic coupling conveys the error voltage to the
primary side where the error voltage modulates the PWM and adjusts ton.
Magnetically-coupled feedback permits operation with the power supplies’
output return floating or isolated from the input return.

Detailed Circuit Description
Chip U1, a Vishay Si9110, provides the required PWM functions.  Resistor
R2 sets the internal clock frequency of the PWM to approximately 600 kHz,
which is twice the chopping or switching frequency (Figure 19).  The bias
current of U1 is set by resistor R3.  Diode D15 and associated components
shift U1’s soft-reference voltage to improve operation at elevated
temperature.
Transistor Q1 buffers the output of the PWM and provides the additional
current drive needed to rapidly switch mosfet Q2 on and off (Figure 20).
Mosfet Q2 controls the application of supply voltage to the primary of the
flyback transformer T2.  When Q2 is on, the primary current ramps up at a
rate determined by T2 and Vin.  Transformer T1, a 1:100 current
transformer, couples the primary current to diode D9 and resistor R9.
Resistor R9 converts the primary current ramp to a voltage ramp.  Resistor
R8 and capacitor C18 filter the voltage ramp and apply it to U1 (Figure 21)
at the “sense” pin.  The error voltage at U1-14 is internally compared to the

Transformer T2 has four secondary windings; two windings provide power
supply operating voltages, while the third and fourth windings provide the
main ±5.0-volt outputs.  The secondary winding associated with rectifier
D13 provides approximately 5.0 Vdc for powering the circuitry on the
primary side of T2.  Rectifier D6 and associated components provide
approximately 5.0 Vdc for powering the circuitry on the secondary side of
T2.  Components D4, D5, C23, C24, C30, and C31 constitute the main
rectifier and filter circuit for the ±5.0 Vdc outputs.  The ±5.0 Vdc outputs are
further filtered by L3, C25, C32, C36, C26, C27, C53, C55, C33, C34, C56,
and C57 before application to output terminals E4, E5, and E6 (Figure 23).

Chip U5 and associated components constitute the output voltage sensing
or error detection circuitry.  Chip U5 compares the ±5.0 Vdc output
voltages divided down by R31 and R32 to the 2.5 Vdc reference voltage
provided by U2.  The output of U5 is buffered by Q5 whose emitter drives
T3.  Components R40, C49, and C50 provide negative feedback to the
inverting input of U5 to shape the loop gain, which ensures stable operation
and adequate transient response.  The voltage at the emitter of Q5 is the
error voltage.  To couple the DC error voltage through T3, it is necessary to
use amplitude modulation such that the error signal can be magnetically
coupled to the secondary side of T3.  Chip U4 provides a ~700-kHz carrier,
which is amplitude modulated by the error voltage applied through the
center tap of T3.  Diode D12 with C14 and R15 serve to demodulate or
recover the magnetically coupled modulated error voltage signal.
Components C52 and R42 provide additional error voltage signal filtering
(Figure 26).  Chip U3 with R12, R35, R13, R14, R4, and C15 further
amplify and filter the error voltage.  Due to the interleaving of the main
secondary winding, the -5.0 Vdc output closely tracks the +5.0 Vdc output,
provided that the negative load current is not less than 20% of the positive
load current.

Transistor Q3, chip U3, and associated components provide a soft start
function, which ensures that the ±5.0-Vdc output ramps up in predictable
manner.  Transistor Q3 is on when INH (E3) is held low, which keeps C8
discharged.  Chip U3-7 is also low to maintain C11 discharged through D7.
When Q3 is released, both capacitors are allowed to charge, controlling the
rate at which the ±5.0-Vdc output ramps up (Figure 25).

Transistor Q4, diodes D2, D1, and D8, and associated passive
components provide +10 Vdc start-up power for the primary side
components.  Once the power supply starts and the secondary outputs
come up, the winding associated with D13 provides the primary operating
power, i.e.; the power supply becomes self sustaining, producing its own
operating power.  The 5.0-Vdc output from D13 and D2 (5, 2) provide a
reverse bias to D2 (3, 4), which turns Q4 off for improved efficiency.

Capacitors C1, C2, C5 through C7 and C9 minimize the differential and
common-mode noise on the 28-Vdc line.  Also, C1 and C2 provide a low
inductance voltage source for the primary power circuit consisting of Q2

and T2.  Capacitor C10 and resistor R16 serve to dampen the ringing on
the drain of Q2 at turn off.


Tracing Through A Cycle Of Operation
Assume that the output of PWM U1-4 has gone high, turning on Q2 and
marking the start of the conduction interval.  Vin (+28 Vdc) appears across
the primary of T2 and the primary current of T2 begins to ramp up linearly.
Diodes D13, D4, D5, and D6 are reversed biased during this interval since
the secondaries’ polarity is inverted with respect to the primary.  Output
current from each secondary is supplied by capacitors C44, C23, C24,
C30, C31, and C39 during this interval.  As previously discussed, the
primary current is fed back to the PWM sense input (U1-3), after being
converted to a voltage.  The ramp voltage internal to the PWM is compared
to the error voltage and when the ramp voltage is greater than the error
voltage, the output of the PWM goes low, causing Q2 to turn off.  This
designates the end of the conduction interval and the start of the flyback
interval.
Since the current flowing in an inductor can not be instantaneously
stopped, current must continue to flow in T2 even though Q2 is off.  When
Q2 turns off, the primary voltage reverses and increases until the
secondary rectifier diodes are forward biased and conducting (Figure 22).
Current that was flowing in the primary is now transferred to the secondary.
The current that flows in each secondary winding is a function of its turns
ratio.  Secondary current primarily flows through capacitors C44, C23, C24,
C30, C31, and C39, restoring their charge.  Secondary current will continue
to flow until all magnetic energy stored in the air gap of T2 is transferred to
the output capacitors (electric field energy).
The dead-time interval now commences.  During this interval all power
switching components (Q2, D13, D4, D5, and D6) are off, hence the name
discontinuous mode (no switching current flows during the dead-time
interval).  The only current flowing is the load current, which is provided by
the output capacitors.  On the next clock edge the cycle repeats.

2.6.2 + 3.3 V POWER SUPPLY
The 1241 XB RTeX +3.3 V Power Supply Assembly (A3000976000)
supplies a regulated output voltage of 3.3 Vdc at 1.7 Adc load current from
an input voltage of 18 Vdc to 36 Vdc; 28 Vdc is typical.

OVERVIEW
Refer to the block diagram in Figure 27 and schematic drawing
A3000976 SCH during the following discussions of the 3.3 V power
supplies.

The +3.3 V power supply is a switching power supply that operates at 300
kHz and employs a single-transistor discontinuous-mode flyback topology.
Operation is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) IC that controls
chopping (switching) of the 28 Vdc input voltage at a fixed frequency (300
kHz).  Each switching cycle is subdivided into three operating intervals:
conduction, flyback, and dead time.
Current flows in the primary of the flyback transformer and magnetic
energy is stored in the transformer’s air gap during the conduction interval.
The power supplies’ output capacitors maintain the output voltage.

When the conduction interval terminates, stored magnetic energy is
released to the secondary of the transformer and the power supplies’
output capacitors are charged.  The supply is designed such that the
conduction interval (ton) varies according to the demand placed on the
power supply to maintain a constant output voltage.
The dead time interval commences when all stored magnetic energy is
depleted.  Again the output capacitors maintain the output voltage.  The
dead-time interval ends on the rising edge of the next PWM clock, which
also marks the start of the next conduction interval.
For the following equation it can be seen that as Vin and / or Io change the
PWM re-adjusts ton to maintain a constant Vo.

T is the switching period, 1/300 kHz

ton is the conduction time

Vo is the regulated 3.3 Vdc output

Io is the 3.3 Vdc output current

Lp is the Flyback transformer’s primary inductance

Output voltage sensing or error detection compares the output voltage to a
stable reference voltage and a resulting error voltage is created on the
secondary side.  Magnetic coupling conveys the error voltage to the
primary side where the error voltage modulates the PWM and adjusts ton.
Magnetically-coupled feedback permits operation with the power supplies’
output return floating or isolated from the input return.

Detailed Circuit Description
Chip U1, a Vishay Si9110, provides the required PWM functions.  Resistor
R2 sets the internal clock frequency of the PWM to approximately 600 kHz,
which is twice the chopping or switching frequency (Figure 28).  The bias
current of U1 is set by resistor R3.  Diode D15 and associated components
shift U1’s soft reference voltage to improve operation at elevated

Transistor Q1 buffers the output of the PWM and provides the additional
current drive needed to rapidly switch mosfet Q2 on and off (Figure 29).
Mosfet Q2 controls the application of supply voltage to the primary of the
flyback transformer T2.  When Q2 is on, the primary current ramps up at a
rate determined by T2 and Vin.  Transformer T1, a 1:100 current
transformer, couples the primary current to diode D9 and resistor R9.
Resistor R9 converts the primary current ramp to a voltage ramp.  Resistor
R8 and capacitor C18 filter the voltage ramp and apply it to U1 (Figure 30)
at the “sense” pin.  The error voltage at U1-14 is internally compared to the
voltage ramp to produce a voltage pulse at U1-4 that controls the
conduction time (ton) of Q2.
Transformer T2 has three secondary windings; two windings provide power
supply operating voltages, while the third winding is the main 3.3 volt
output.  The secondary winding associated with rectifier D13 provides
approximately 12 Vdc for powering the circuitry on the primary side of T2.
Rectifier D6 and associated components provide approximately 5 Vdc for
powering the circuitry on the secondary side of T2.  Components D4, C23,
and C24 constitute the main rectifier and filter circuit for the +3.3 Vdc
output.  The +3.3 Vdc output is further filtered by L1, L3, C25, C32, C26,
C27, and C28 before application to output terminals E4 and E5 (Figure

2.6.3 INPUT FILTER BOARDS

There are two Input Filter boards for the six power supplies.  The Input
Filter and Delay Controller PCB Assembly (A3000467000) provides
common mode and differential mode filtering of the +28 Vdc input voltage
for up to three power supply modules.  It also provides low-voltage inhibit
and programmable start-up delays for the attached supplies.  Refer to
harmonics of the power supply modules attached to connector J1and
prevents noise contamination of the 28 V bus.
The heart of the delay controller is a programmable microcontroller (U1).
Resistor R7 and capacitor C12 set the operating frequency at
approximately 1 MHz.  Diode D1 and R6 function as a simple Zener power
supply that provides 5 V for the microcontroller.
When enabled, U1 functions as a timer to control the turn-on time and
sequencing of the power-supply modules attached to connector J1.  There
are basically three functions concerning this circuit: (1) a voltage threshold,
(2) the delay and sequencing circuit and (3), the control/inhibit circuit.

(1)
A threshold voltage is established using a voltage divider consisting
of R4 and R5.  When the divider output exceeds 1.25 V as detected
by power fail input (PFI) U2-4, the RESET pin (U2-7) goes high.
This happens when voltage on the 28 V bus exceeds 20 volts or
more.  With U2’s reset pin high, U1’s MCLR (U1-4) is pulled high,
and U1 begins executing its internally stored program.
(2)
The delay provided by U1 is the time from when U1’s MCLR goes
high to the time INH1 (J1-4) goes high.  Different combinations of
jumpers JP1 – JP4 change U1’s delay time.  Delay times are
established for different tools to limit the current demand when the
tool string is first powered up.  Delay times, in milliseconds, and

In addition, jumper JP6 determines if INH2 (J1-7) and INH3 (J1-
10) go high simultaneously with INH1 or are staggered by 40
msec.  The two states of jumper JP6 are as follows:
•
JP6 jumpered = staggered High-to-Low transition of RA1 – RA3
•
JP6 not jumpered = Simultaneous High-to-Low transition of RA1
– RA3

(3)
When +5 volts is applied to the microcontroller, outputs RA1 –
RA3 of U1 are floating (open collector circuit).  Resistors R8, R12,
and R14 pull the bases of Q1 – Q3 HIGH respectively, turning on
Q1 – Q3, which result in INH1 – INH3 being pulled low.  This low
state inhibits operation of the power supply modules connected to
INH1 – INH3.  When U1’s time-out function is complete, outputs
RA1 – RA3 will transition LOW either simultaneously or staggered
as determined by jumper JP6, turning off Q1 – Q3, which activates
the power supply modules.

Because very little power is dissipated on this board, there is no need to
mount it on a heat sink.  Therefore, it is mounted to the electronics chassis
using standoffs."

the instrument.  Mechanical WTS compatibility is achieved via the 1241 PA top sub and
the 1241 XB bottom sub.
Electronics Chassis Assembly
Electronic circuits and discrete parts mount on an I-beam chassis and include the
following components.
• Six DC power supplies,
• Controller board containing communication interface, guard drivers, data acquisition
and control circuits, calibration and verification circuits, etc.
• Preamp board containing circuits for measuring VM1 and I0 (read as I zero), as well
as a means for sending them to the Controller board,
• Bucker board provides the survey current,
• Various chassis mounted components.

Physical Attributes
For an overview of how the major instrument components electrically and sometimes
mechanically, tie together, see the block diagram of Figure 2.

Electrode Rings: Twenty one electrode rings encircle the housing and connect to the
inner electronics using feedthroughs.  Electrode pairs are spaced along the
mandrel at specific distances to achieve varying depths of investigation.  The
electrode rings have a mild steel surface to promote rusting and it is this rust that

isolates the electrode rings from the inner titanium housing.
A4 and A4': Metal end pieces of the housing also serve as electrodes, A4 and A4'.  Two
isolation joints within the housing separate these two end pieces from the inner
housing.  Instruments connected above and below the RTeX extend the electrical
length of the A4 electrodes.  Springs mounted on the top and bottom snorkel
sections of the chassis make contact to the end pieces through the electronics.
Fiberglass: A fiberglass assembly holds all the contact sockets that mate with the
feedthroughs.  Each contact is loosely held in place by a set of magnets so that it
has freedom to align with the feedthrough.
Copper Pipes: Copper pipes are attached to the bottom side of the fiberglass assembly.
Their purpose is to provide a low-resistance connection between the top and
bottom guard electrode pairs: A1-A1’, A2-A2’, A3-A3' and A4-A4'.  Each pipe has
a different outer diameter so that they fit inside one another.  Kapton tape is
wrapped around each pipe for insulation.  Connection to A5 and A5' is made with
a wire that runs through the center of these pipes.
Chassis Potential: A spring-loaded contact assembly on the chassis provides
connection to the inner housing.  Rather than leaving the inner housing floating, a

Since WTS tools are powered using a nominal 180 Vac at the cablehead, this power
adapter is no exception.  As is typical, this AC voltage is delivered to the top connector
(J1) on pins 1 and 4.

The object of the 1241 PA power adapter is to take the supplied voltage and convert it to
a nominal +28 Vdc.  To start this process, the voltage must be reduced to a lower level ---

Refer to assembly drawing A3001978000, its BOM and schematic A3001978 SCH for
the following descriptions.

The only PC board of this simple instrument rectifies the AC and controls the passing of
DC power to the attached load; in this case, only the 1241 XB RTeX.

The board receives AC on terminals E1 and E2.  Alternating current is rectified by a full-
wave bridge composed of diodes D1 – D4.  This rectified output is heavily filtered using
capacitors C1 – C8.  Resistors R1 – R3 are also connected across the rectified output to
assist in bleeding off the charge on the capacitors after AC power is removed.

Unregulated DC voltage is provided as the output on two terminals E3 (+) and E4 (–).
This output voltage is available to the load (1241 XB RTeX) exiting out the bottom
connector (J2) on pins 11 (+) and 12 (–) --- see the tool wiring diagram A3001976 WRD.

This unregulated DC output swings between 23 – 36 Vdc over an input operating range
of 150 to 220 Vac.  Cut-off circuits reduce this output to zero volts when input voltages
are outside this range.  This protects the regulated power supplies found in the RTeX
from low/high input voltage should something unexpected occur.

The over/under protection is provided by the supervisory circuits of U1 and U2 found on

Before discussing the protection circuits, let’s look at how the
chips associated with them get their power.
After the full-wave rectifier creates a raw DC voltage source, it
is heavily filtered with a bank of capacitors.  From this raw DC,
a simple zener diode circuit (R4, D6 & C9) provides power for
the four IC’s U1, U2, U3 and U5.  See Figure 1.  This circuit

accidentally being applied to the load.  More details about under-voltage operation
are found in the next topic."
1241XB-RTEX-AMO,1241PA Circuit Description ................................................. ……………… - 3.2 UNDER-VOLTAGE PROTECTION...............................................................................3,"UNDER-VOLTAGE PROTECTION
The circuit components chosen to surround supervisory chip U2 (Analog Devices
ADM706) establish under-voltage protection --- see Figure 2 below.
Voltage divider network (R6 and R9) keeps the input voltage for the Power-Fail
Input (PFI) at a sufficiently low level as to not trip the internal comparator until the
filtered DC voltage exceeds approximately 23 volts.  (Note: expressed voltages
are for discussion only and are subject to tolerances of manufactured components,
wireline length, AC loading and +28 V loading.)
As long as this input remains below this threshold (anything less than 150 Vac for
CHV), the output voltage to the RTeX is effectively zero.  When the PFI input
remains below 1.25 V at the voltage divider connection, it keeps the comparator in
an untripped state --- the Power-Fail Output (PFO) stays low under this condition.
With PFO tied to the chip Manual Reset pin (MR), it keeps the chip out of reset
mode and the /RESET pin is low --- test point TP2 is provided for checking this
logic level.  This low level output provides a low to one of the inputs of the NAND
gate, U5 B.  See logic levels in Figure 2 below and Table 1.  Notice that anytime
one of the inputs to the NAND gate is low, the output is high.

the NAND gate are high (U5 pin 3 output is low).  This occurs only after being
inverted again by U3 --- this high on the inverter output enables the transistor and
allows current to flow.
For under-voltage protection, the high level output of the U5 NAND gate connects
to the inputs of driver/inverter U3.  With a low on the output of U3, the gate of FET
Q1 is kept biased in an OFF state and the return path of the unregulated DC
voltage is interrupted; that is, no current can flow through the attached RTeX load.
Thus, with Q1 biased OFF, under-voltage protection is provided.  The only time
that current can flow is shown in the bottom row of the table, when both inputs are
high and Q1 is turned ON --- this unique condition only occurs for the normal
operating range which we will discuss later.
A similar cutoff response occurs for the situation when too much voltage is applied.

The circuit components chosen to surround the other supervisory chip U1 (Analog
Devices ADM706) establish over-voltage protection.
Voltage divider network (R7 and R8) keeps the input voltage for the Power-Fail
Input (PFI) at a sufficiently low level as to not trip the internal comparator until the
filtered DC voltage exceeds approximately 36 volts.  (Note: expressed voltages
are for discussion only and are subject to tolerances of manufactured components,
wireline length, AC loading and +28 V loading.)
As soon as this voltage divider network exceeds 1.25 V at the input, it trips the
comparator --- the Power-Fail Output (PFO) goes and stays high under this
condition.
With PFO tied to the chip Manual Reset pin (MR), it keeps the chip in reset mode
and the /RESET pin is high --- test point TP1 is provided for checking this logic
level.  U5 A is used as an inverter and provides a low to one of the inputs of the
NAND gate, U5 B.  Remember, anytime one of the inputs of the NAND gate is low,
the output is high --- again, see Table 1.
The output of the U5 B connects to the inputs of driver/inverter U3.  With a low on
the output of U3, it keeps the gate of FET Q1 biased in an OFF state and the
return path of the unregulated DC voltage is interrupted, that is, no current can
flow through the RTeX.  Thus, with Q1 biased OFF, over-voltage protection is
provided.

The secret to allowing the operating voltage (+28 Vdc - nominal) to be passed to
the 1241 XB RTeX is in knowing how the two protection circuits behave through the
normal operating range --- we have already observed how they work for their
respective protection in cutting off current flow.
Part of this secret is the fact that, for normal operation, both protection circuits
place a high on the inputs of NAND gate U5 B during this time --- see Figure 4,
and remember Table 1.  This condition ultimately provides a high on the output
pins of U3 (driver/inverter) and thus the gate of Q1.  With a high placed on the gate
of Q1, the return path for the unregulated DC voltage is completed so that current
can flow through the load.

To further explain this operation, let’s consider the circuit is at its optimum
operating voltage of +28 Vdc.

Let’s look at the over-voltage circuit first.  Considering the voltage divider attached
to the PFI pin of U1, the voltage at the junction of R7 and R8 is 0.95 Vdc when 28
volts is present.  This is below the comparator threshold of 1.25 V, so /PFO is low.
This makes /RESET low also.  The inverter of U5 A places a high on one of the two
inputs of U5 B (pin 6).
The opposite condition exists for U2.  The voltage divider of R6 and R9 is at
1.38 Vdc.  This is above the comparator threshold and makes /PFO high.  This
makes the /RESET pin high also.  Since the second input pin of U5 B (pin 5) ties to
this reset pin, there are now two highs on the inputs of the NAND gate.  This
condition results in a low at the output pin (3) of U5 B --- see logic levels of
The many inputs of U3, all paralleled, tie to output pin 3 of U5 B.  Since the output
pins of driver/inverter chip, U3, ties to the gate of transistor Q1, the high output
turns ON Q1.  Test point TP3 is provided to easily check the state of this condition
--- see Figure 5.  With Q1 turned ON, current is allowed to pass freely through
source and drain.
Thus, it can be seen that when the voltage is within the operating thresholds of the
two protection circuits, Q1 passes the necessary power to the 1241 XB RTeX.  And
when the applied voltage is outside this range, Q1 acts like an open circuit to

One last point in the description of these protection circuits is the hysteresis that is
designed into them.
A problem exists when the circuit applies power to the load, the surge in current
can cause a sufficient dip in the raw DC voltage (remember it is unregulated) that
the circuit will trip back OFF.  Right at the circuit threshold, an ON-OFF oscillating
condition can occur as it applies power and then the dip removes it.  To prevent
this from happening, a resistor is added into each circuit to provide hysteresis.
Let’s consider the under-voltage circuit.  Resistor R11 is added from the /RESET
pin (/CLR) back around to the voltage comparator input (pin 4).  When /CLR is low,
R11 is effectively in parallel with R6, establishing the “trip point” for the
comparator.  With sufficient voltage applied, as soon as the comparator trips and
/CLR is high, the connection to R11 raises the threshold and prevents accidental
tripping back OFF.
This same solution applies to the over-voltage circuit with the use of R12 as the
feedback resistor.
The effect of altering the trip point means that once tripped ON/OFF, the DC
voltage must be reduced beyond the trip point before being active again.  To
illustrate this, see Table 2 below.

P/N 107846-935
MARCH 2000
The 1311 Gamma Ray (G/R) instrument is a single-conductor tool used to distinguish between
various rock formations.  A scintillation detector, composed of a crystal and a photomultiplier
(PM) tube, detects and measures the level of natural gamma radiation in the formation.  The
intensity of radiation gives an indication as to the type of rock along the well bore.
The G/R electronics assembly, which processes this information, divides into two sections.  The
lower electronics is encased in a protective vacuum flask and includes the:
• scintillation detector
• discriminator module 118175
• heat sink assembly
Urethane in the flask acts as a coolant to protect these heat-sensitive devices for several hours in
wells whose temperatures can rise as high as 400°F (204°C).  (However, when the instrument has
operated for several hours at 200°F or higher, and the tool is to be used further with little time
between jobs, the heat sink assembly should be removed and allowed to cool outside the flask.)
The upper electronics package is attached to the vacuum flask and contains the following:
• power supply for high and low voltages
• flip-flop module 89174
• line driver module 100145
• polarity switch
The G/R tool may be combined with the 2302 CCL and the 2421 instruments to form the 2404
CCL-G/R-Neutron instrument.  Figure 1 shows the G/R tool in combination with the CCL
instrument.  See Equipment Specifications Sheet (107846-925) for the length dimensions with

2.0 POWER SUPPLY 78339:  Refer to Schematic D79402
The power supply, located in the upper electronics package, provides both the low and high
voltages required by the instrument.  The low-voltage supply (24 Vdc) powers the
discriminator, flip-flop, and the line driver modules.  The high-voltage supply provides the
detector with the required 1550 Vdc operating voltage.
150 Vdc feeds the power supply circuit from the cablehead.  Protective diode D201 allows
only positive DC voltage to pass from the cablehead to the power supply.  An oscillating
circuit, composed of the two primaries of transformer T201, transistor Q301, and other
associated components, converts the 150 Vdc source into an AC voltage, which is then
applied across the upper and lower secondaries of T201 for the low and high voltage circuits,
respectively.  Inductor L401 and capacitors C201 and C202 prevent the oscillating voltage
from backing up the 150 volt line."

5.0 DETECTOR CIRCUIT:   Refer to Detector Schematic B77497
The G/R detector, housed in the vacuum flask, consists of a scintillation cesium-iodide
crystal, coupled to a photomultiplier (PM) tube.  Gamma rays from the formation enter the
crystal where they ionize and give off energy.  This ionization energy is converted into tiny
flashes of light (photons).  In the PM tube, these photons are changed into electrical pulses
that are amplified through a series of twelve dynodes.
The pulse height from the tube is proportional to the energy of the incident gamma rays.
Since different levels (i.e., count rates) of gamma radiation are associated with different types
of rock, the information from the detector can be used to indicate formation lithology.
6.0 DISCRIMINATOR MODULE 118175: Refer to schematic B118176
The discriminator module, also housed in the vacuum flask, filters the detector signal.
Pulses from the PM tube enter the module on pin 4, while 24 Vdc powers the discriminator
on pin 3.  Capacitor C1 couples the input signal to emitter-follower Ql, which lowers the
signal impedance before passing it on to comparator-amplifier A1.  At pin 7, located between
Ql and Al, the emitter-follower output may be observed.
Al blocks the passage of low-amplitude signals (such as noise from the PM tube) by acting
as an on-off switch in the following manner.  Al compares the pulse observed at pin 7 to a
reference voltage determined by Rselect.  In the low-level hook up for the discriminator,
Rselect is a lK potentiometer connected across pins 1 and 5, with the wiper connected to pin
8 (refer to schematic A106333).  An approximate trigger voltage is measured between pins 5
and 8.  When the pulse at pin 7 is larger in amplitude than the voltage between pins 5 and 8,
the comparator turns ""on"" and outputs (at module pin 6) a negative pulse of approximately
12 volts.  Conversely, when the pulse at pin 7 is smaller in amplitude, A1 switches off and no
voltage appears at the module output.
The width of the output pulse at pin 6 is determined by the duration that the pulse exceeds
the trigger voltage.  The discrimination range for low-level hook up is approximately 40 to
1000 mV."

7.0 FLIP-FLOP MODULE 89174: Refer to Drawing B89174
The flip-flop module is located in the upper electronics package.  The low-voltage
power circuit supplies the module with 24 Vdc at pin 5.  Resistor R1 and diode D1 reduce
and regulate this voltage to the 12 Vdc supply needed to power the CMOS binary counter,
IC1.
Pulses from the discriminator enter the module at pin 2, where the binary counter reduces
the pulse rate by a factor of two.  That is, for every two pulses in, the module outputs only
one pulse at pin 7.  Scaling down the pulse rate in this way reduces both the power required
by the line driver and the number of pulses sent up the logging cable to the surface.
8.0 LINE DRIVER MODULE 100145: Refer to Drawing B 100145
The line driver is located in the upper electronics package.  The module produces pulses of
uniform width for transmission to the surface electronics.  Pin 1 of the line driver couples the
module to the flip-flop output.  A power supply of 24 Vdc enters on pin 5.
Rl and Cl differentiate the input signal.  When the voltage of the differentiated pulse rises to
approximately a of the supply voltage at pin 5, the pulse triggers a one-shot multivibrator
(Al).  The triggering produces a steep-sloped, positive-going pulse at pin 10 on Al.  Time
components R2 and C2 set the width of the pulse (nominally 30-35 microseconds wide).
This pulse switches on transistor Ql, which amplifies the signal and induces a pulse-voltage
in the secondary of transformer T1.  The transformer matches the impedance of the signal to
that of the logging cable, making it possible to transmit pulses to the surface through long
lines.
Diodes D2 and Dl protect Ql from damaging voltage reversals.  Steering diodes D3 and D4
are connected to pins 3 and 8 for pulse-polarity selection.  Negative pulses leave the module
between pins 4 and 8.
9.0 POLARITY SWITCH (SW201): Refer to Schematic D79402
The polarity switch, located in the upper electronics package (see drawing D78886), routes
the pulses from the line driver to the cablehead connector.  During G/R logging operations,
only negative pulses are transmitted to the surface.
The following circuitry is incorporated into the G/R electronics only when auxiliary
instruments or adapters are attached to the G/R tool."

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE          1329 XA/XB WTS SPECTRALOG 1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION
The Atlas Wireline Services Spectralog was first introduced to the oil industry for commercial use in
1969.
The 1329 XA/XB SPECTRALOG tool is used for (a) lithology identification, (b) determination of clay
type and clay content, (c) measuring bed thickness, (d) locating uranium by-product buildup in a cased
well, and (e) identifying potential fracture zones.
The 1329 XB instrument incorporates additional feed-thru wires to support RCI motoring.  Current
production supports the 1329 XB, but 1329 XA instruments can be modified by completing FMN 96-39,
if necessary.
Currently, the RCI is the only instrument that requires the additional wiring of the 1329 XB, but it may
also be run in all other standard combinations.
There are many radioactive sources.  Potassium(K), uranium(U), and thorium(Th) are of particular
interest to the oil/gas industry.  Virtually all of the gamma radiation detected by downhole instruments
can be classified in one of these three categories."
1329-SL-AMO,Brief Description of Service/Equipment - 1.1 LITHOLOGY INTERPRETATION,"The 1329 XA/XB SPECTRALOG differs from a gamma ray instrument - which records total gamma
rays as a function of depth - in that it also measures the discrete energy of each gamma ray detected.
The discrimination of the total gamma ray signal into discrete energy levels or windows, infers the
individual amounts of potassium(K), uranium(U), and thorium(Th).  As a result, certain lithology
ambiguities can be resolved which often exist when using only total gamma ray signal.
Example:
Given a high total gamma ray count over a 40 foot interval, the signal could could be indicative of
a shale zone.  If that signal was mostly composed of uranium gamma rays, it could be indicative of
a fault plane where uranium carrying fluid had migrated.
For a high uranium and moderate thorium gamma ray content, the same signal could be indicative
of phosphatic rock.
In yet another case, high potassium and low uranium and thorium, the signal could indicate illite
clay.
In general, the potassium(K), uranium(U), and thorium(Th) contents of rocks yield strong clues as to
formation identity."
1329-SL-AMO,Brief Description of Service/Equipment - BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE          1329XA/XB WTS SPECTRALOG 1.2 INSTRUMENTATION,"2
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE          1329 XA/XB WTS SPECTRALOG 1.2 INSTRUMENTATION
The 1329 XA/XB SPECTRALOG contains a high resolution 2 x 12 inch Cesium Iodide (CsI) crystal
optically coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT).
An advantage of a CsI crystal over other crystal detectors is the severe conditions of shock and
vibration it can withstand.
When a gamma ray of specific energy (measured in Million electron Volts - MeV's) interacts with the
crystal it is converted to a light pulse (photon).  The intensity of this light is proportional to the gamma
ray's energy.
The light pulse is converted into an electronic pulse and amplified by the PMT of the detector section.
The crystal and photomultiplier tube, along with other critical electronic components, are housed in
a vacuum flask for temperature control.
The outer diameter of the instrument is 3-5/8 inches.
PMT output voltages -proportional to gamma ray energy levels- are passed through a filter and linear
amplifier, digitized by a multichannel microprocessor-controlled spectrum analyzer, and stored in
spectrum-memory locations.
Each 16 bit memory address (1 word), for a given energy level, is one channel within a 256 channel
spectrum.  Each channel can store a maximum of 64 K pulses.
For each spectrum sample, some channels may have a zero value because no gamma radiation was
detected for that energy level.
There are typically 4 spectrum samples/ft at a typical logging speed of 10 ft/min.  The sample rate can
be changed.  If SPL II acquisition software is used the typical logging spped is 30 ft/min.
As the sampling continues (CsI is constantly bombarded) and more gamma rays are detected, each
excitation voltage (discrete energy level) is stored in a designated memory address (channel) for that
energy level.
This digitization process takes place within the instrument so that analog pulses do not travel over long
logging cables which can easily degrade signal voltages."

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE          1329 XA/XB WTS SPECTRALOG
1.0 GENERAL CIRCUIT  DESCRIPTION (see Figure 936-2)
When a gamma ray of specific energy interacts with the crystal it is converted to a light pulse (photon).
The light intensity will be proportional to the gamma ray's energy.  The light pulse is converted into an
electronic pulse and amplified by the PMT of the Detector circuit (see Figure 936-1, balloon 1).
The pulse is conditioned through the Preamp PCB (see Figure 936-1, balloon 2) that outputs a positive
voltage pulse.  This pulse corresponds to the energy level of that gamma ray.
The Pulse Height Analyzer PCB (see Figure 936-1, balloon 3) samples the peak of that pulse, and outputs
an 8-bit word equivalent.
The digitally converted pulse is strobed through the FIFO section (see Figure 936-1, balloon 4), so that no
data will be lost if microcontroller 2 is doing other tasks.  
The 1 K x 8-bit Spectrum RAM (see Figure 936-1, balloon 5) stores data for two spectrums.  Under normal
conditions, one spectrum will be collected until a depth interrupt occurs.  That first spectrum is stored and
the second will begin to be generated in a different spectrum memory location.  The first spectrum is
transmitted while the second spectrum is collecting.
The Spectrum Analyzer PCB will create a spectrum of 256 channels.  Each channel can hold up to 64 K
pulses.
Pre-programmed microcontroller 2 (µC 2) (see Figure 936-1, balloon 6) coordinates all the tasks on the
spectrum analyzer PCB. 
When µC 2 issues a transmit data command , a timing logic is initialized by loading the shift registers and
latches (see Figure 936-1, balloon 7).
The timing logic controls the shift registers speed, so that data will be synchronized to the transmission rate
of T5 Mode Manchester IC (see Figure 936-1, balloon 8).  The timing logic also allows for the transfer
of the 16-bit words to the Manchester without intervention of µC 2.
After the transmission of each word to T5 Mode Manchester IC, a new word is loaded to the shift registers
from the latches by the timing logic, an interrupt is sent to µC 2, and this causes µC 2 to load a new word
into the latches.
The I/O PCB (see Figure 936-1, balloon 9) conditions data for transmission onto the wireline, and recovers
signals from the wireline for T2 Mode Manchester IC to decode.
MicroController 1 (see Figure 936-1, balloon 10) has an internal counter that stores the number of pulses
that the PHA board converts.  µC 1 receives its commands through T2  Manchester IC (see Figure 936-1,
balloon 11).  µC 1 also transmits through T2 when necessary, and communicates via its serial port with µC
2.  This is a one way communication, called half duplex.  µC 1 also controls a dual Digital/Analog
converter (see Figure 936-1, balloon 12).
The dual D/A provides the discrimination level for the PHA board, and the voltage control for the Venus
High Voltage power supply.

1.0 WTS INSTRUMENT BUS (drawing 148666-100)

WTS-IB is an eighteen conductor bus that provides instrument and motoring power to the tool string, passes
commands from the acquisition system via WTS Common Remote (WTS-CR), passes the data from the tools to
the WTS-CR, and provides for electrode and reference lines.

All WTS instruments are required to support the WTS-IB.  All tools in the string are connected in parallel to the
bus, which is created in the WTS-CR.

The Bus Terminal PCB (148666) is a passive board that receives the WTS bus coming from the top connector
and routes it to the bottom connector.  All of the wiring interface between the tool and bus takes place on this
board.


2.0 LOCAL TERMINAL PCB  (drawings 148667-100 and 148982-100)

The Local Terminal PCB connects the electronics package with the rest of the tool.  All the regulated voltages
of the tool and the buffered Manchester's input/output can be found on this board.


3.0 DETECTOR CIRCUIT  (drawing 152111-000)

The Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) is a very sensitive device, suitable for gamma radiation detection when used
with a scintillation detector.  When a gamma ray passes through a CsI detector crystal, a discrete flash of light
is produced due to an exchange of energy inside the crystal.  The intensity of such scintillation is a function of
the energy of the gamma ray.

A spring mechanically maintains the PMT & PMT-socket against the crystal.

The Cesium Iodine crystal is optically coupled to the PMT cathode, which is a photo-electric transducer.  The
emitted electrons are directed by an electric field to the first dynode.  A number of secondary electrons are
emitted at this dynode and are directed to each progressive dynode.  A final amplification of approximately 106
is achieved.

The electrons from the last dynode are collected by the anode which provides the signal current.  This current
produces a voltage pulse when passing through R13.  The voltage pulse, which is negative going, is applied to
the Linear Pre-Amplifier through coupling capacitor C13 (P8/pin3).

The rest of the resistors and capacitors contained in the PMT socket are necessary to adjust the gain of the
PMT.

The K-15 Venus power supply is the high voltage source required by the PMT.  This device is a variable
DC/DC converter that produces a 300 to 1500 Vdc output from an input of 3 to 15 Vdc.  Using this
configuration, the gain of the PMT can be adjusted to compensate for different drifts that may appear in this
circuit or the rest of the tool.

VENUS POWER SUPPLY is filtered on High Voltage Filter PCB 141047.  This board is attached to the PMT
socket."

4.0 LINEAR PRE-AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT (drawing 148654-100)

IC2 is an inverting amplifier.

R28, C11 and R18 perform a common remote differentiation with pole-zero cancellation.  The pole-zero
cancellation is used to cancel undershoot caused by the RC inter stage coupling between amplifier stages.  If
left uncorrected, the under shoot will cause a baseline shift and affect the quality of the measured data.

R18 is used to adjust the amplitude of the pulse before it enters the final stage of gain.  Any variation of the
gain is controlled by the microprocessor of the tool.  Gain is varied by controlling the high voltage bias of the
PMT.

IC3, a non-inverting amplifier, integrates the input signal to obtain a semi-quassian pulse shape.  C15 is the
coupling capacitor to the output of IC3.

Q6, Q7, D1 and D2 set the voltage baseline of the pulses.  This active baseline regenerator keeps the baseline
from shifting.  Variation in the baseline will affect the accuracy and quality of the data.  This is especially
important in spectroscopic circuits where baseline shifts correspond to shifts in energy levels.

The Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA) receives an analog pulse and converts the peak amplitude to a digital value.
When a pulse enters the PHA PCB on J1/pin16 (SIG-IN) it will be present at +Vin of IC5 ready for sampling.
The sampling will take place when the pulse develops maximum amplitude.  IC1, IC2, IC3 and IC4 provide the
timing logic.

Pulse width is approximately 8 μs with maximum amplitude of 5 volts.

IC1 output feeds the inverting input of IC2a and the non-inverting input of IC2b.  IC2a has a threshold voltage
of 54 mv, a greater input pulse amplitude will drive its output LOW.  When the output of IC2a goes LOW it
triggers the one shot IC3a.  The duration of the output pulse (PEAK DETECT) is variable between 3 μs and 4
μs because the value for VR1 is not exactly equal for each tool.  See Repair /Maintenance Procedures -956 for
this adjustment.

The inverting input of IC2b is from software controlled Digital/Analog Converter that is used to adjust the point
of low level discrimination."

The output of IC2b (LLD OUT) is used to turn on IC3b, the sample logic.  The falling edge of Peak Detect and
a HIGH on LLD cause the output of IC3b/pin9 to fall to LOW and trigger IC4a and IC4b.

When IC4a triggers, Q output (pin 6) goes HIGH and sets two conditions:


1)
Disables IC4a & IC4b from being re-triggered.

2) Switches IC5 to SAMPLE & HOLD mode, to capture incoming pulse peak.

When IC4b triggers, Q output goes HIGH for about 3 μs.

The falling edge of Q HIGH (start conversion) enables IC7.  IC7 converts the analog signal on pin 1 into a 12-
bit digital value.  The least significant bits (D0 - D3) of IC7 are discarded, and bits D4 - D11 are buffered
through IC8.

When IC4 a times-out, the IC4/pin7 (HOLD NOT signal) flips from LOW to HIGH, indicating the end of the
conversion.

Each pulse from the PHA is converted into an 8 bit data word and strobed by EOC
___ into U6.

The signal EF
__ shows the status of U6.  As long as data is present in U6 the signal EF
__ will stay HIGH.  U1
(μController) is constantly monitoring EF
__  and, if HIGH, it will generate an ACQUIRE pulse which will strobe
each DATA WORD out of U6 and into latch U3.  The DATA WORD now becomes the lower 8 bit address of
RAM RANK1
_____.  The U1 reads the contents of that RAM address, adds one to the contents value, and writes that
value back into the same RAM address.

Should an overflow occur, the U1 writes ""00000000"" to the address, flips ON the HIBYTE, increments by one
this address, and flips OFF the HIBYTE.

Two locations are associated with each data word; one is obtained with HIBYTE - LOW and one with HIBYTE
- HIGH.

A maximum (64 K-1) pulses for any channel can be stored in RAM."

The Spectrum Analyzer PCB receives commands from the communication PCB using the serial interface
embedded in U1/pin10.  Periodically, U1 receives a FREEZE SPECTRUM command.  When this occurs U1
toggles a signal to RANK0
_____ (RANK0 equals address bit 9 (A9) in RAM).  In this way, a new spectrum is
accumulated in the same manner as in DATA WORD description and the previous spectrum is ""frozen"".

Under normal operation a TX FROZEN SPECTRUM command will follow the FREEZE SPECTRUM
command.  To collect a 2nd spectrum and transmit the first one, U1 alternates between latching the data from
U6 to RAM, and then latching the data from the RAM to input registers U7/U8.  In the first case the pulses
control the address lines of the RAM.  In the second case, μC1 itself controls the address lines. To obtain the
control of the address lines, μC1 turns LOW P2.3 (U1/pin24), activating U2 and deactivating U3.  Access to
external data memory is time-multiplexed in U1.  ALE is used to latch the address byte into U2.  RD
__ and WR
__
are used to strobe the memory.


NOTE


Itemized (Pt x) description of the Manchester transmission is depicted in Figure 945-1

and the remaining text.

U1 activates ENABLE I/O (Pt 1), reads two bytes corresponding to the first channel of the spectrum, and then
deactivates ENABLE I/O.  This action loads the LSB and the MSB of this first channel to the input latches of
U7 and U8 respectively (Pt 6).

LOAD
____ / CTS (Pt 2) is LOW, thus U12 is in the load mode.  ALE is used just for clocking purposes. ""11111111""
are loaded into U12.  U1 toggles LOAD
____ / CTS (Pt 2) is HIGH.  This has the following effects:


a)
Single shot U17 is triggered (Pt 5).  U17 consists of an 8 bit storage latch feeding a parallel-in, serial-
out 8 bit shift register.  The pulse generated by U17 causes a transfer of DATA WORD from U7/U8
input latches to U7/U8 shift registers (Pt 6).


b)
U12 goes from LOAD to COUNT mode and U10 is ENABLED to begin a sending sequence.


c)
An interrupt is generated -signal INT0 (Pt 4).  This interrupt will be used by μC1 to load a new
channel into the input registers of U7/U8 and increment an internal counter.

These events (a, b, and c) happen before the transmission of the first channel occurs.

U3 (Manchester IC) now controls the transmission.  U12 will generate an interrupt each time 16 bits have been
sent.  U1 will stop the pulse acquisition, load and reset a new channel, increment the internal counter, until all
the channels have been sent.  U1 will then toggle LOAD
____ / CTS to LOW, finishing the transmission."

The communication PCB performs the following tasks:


·
All communications that take place in T2 Mode.


·
Decodes all command words and data words coming from the surface interface.


·
Controls input to the Venus Power Supply.


·
Senses different analog voltages present in the tool; ie, temperature inside the flask.

These tasks are coordinated by U1 - μController.  This device has separate address space for the entire
program and data memory (EPROM).

Port 0 serves as a multiplexed address/data bus.  It provides two external interrupts INTO (P3.2) and INT1
(P3.3).  These interrupts are used to control U3 Manchester encoder communication.

Two 16-bit internal counter registers are available.  One of these counters (T0 - P3.4) is used to collect pulses
from PHA.  This is the Total Gamma Ray Counter.  The other counter register is not used.

A full duplex UART is embedded in U1.  This feature is used to transmit commands from the communication
PCB to the spectrum analyzer PCB.

TXD (P3.1) on the communication PCB is connected to RXD (P3.0) on the spectrum PCB.  TXD (P3.1)  is not
connected on the spectrum PCB.  This means the spectrum PCB cannot send any message to the communication
PCB."

8.0 COMMUNICATION PCB - CLS COMMUNICATION (drawing 3000913sch)

U1 controls the Manchester circuit. Most of the control signals in the Manchester are tied directly to the I/O
ports of U1.  U9/pin2 is normally LOW, so DECODER SHIFT CLOCK will be able to propagate and interrupt
U1 only if a COMMAND DATA SYNC arrives.  As soon as U1 decodes the address, it compares this address
with the one for the tool (or the universal one: 00).  If true, it continues decoding the rest of the Manchester
word.  If false, U1 generates a MASTER RESET pulse.  In that way U3 disregards the rest of COMMAND
DATA SYNC and begins waiting for another one.  If the tool receives a command that requires a Manchester
data word, U1 toggles U9/pin2 HIGH.  Now the DECODER SHIFT CLOCK signal will be able to propagate
through U8 and generate the corresponding interrupt.

U19 is a buffer that protects the Manchester chip.

T5 Mode signals from U10 on the spectrum analyzer PCB (P3/pin19- BZO5 and P3/pin20- BOO5) are fed into
this board just for buffering purposes.


9.0 COMMUNICATION PCB - DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER (drawing 3000913sch)

U4 provides the analog voltage that powers the Venus Power Supply.  It is a 12-bit precision DAC loaded with
three 4-bit nibbles.  U1 updates the analog voltage values executing external write instructions.


10.0  COMMUNICATION PCB - ANALOG to DIGITAL CONVERTER (drawing 3000913sch)

Different analog voltages are sensed by the tool and are available if requested from the surface interface.  All
these voltages are sampled by U6.  This IC can constantly sample up to 8 voltages.  One of these voltages is
the tool's internal temperature.  This temperature is sensed by U16.  U16 generates a current that is proportional
to the absolute temperature (1 µA/K).

U15 provides a reference voltage of 2.5 volts. This voltage is subtracted by U11b from the voltage generated
through R3.  This circuit is designed to achieve a value of 0 Vdc for TEMP IN when temperature is close to -
25°C and approximately 5 Vdc when temperature is close to 100°C.

12.0 COMMAND BUS (drawing 148652-100)

This section of the bus receives commands from the WTS-CR.  Two lines, CMD - (P4-6) and CMD +
(P4/pin13), are connected to the brown and yellow wires of bus coupling transformer T1 (X-1258-B).  T1 is
also connected to a resistive biasing network for the input of U1 (DS78 C20).  Termination resistor R1 is
between the gray and green wires of T1.  R1 provides bus termination to minimize ringing and crosstalk pickup.

Resistors (R2, R3, R4 and R5) provide a voltage divider network connected to the differential inputs of U1.
This bias voltage causes the negative input of U1 to be 100 mV higher than the positive input.  This bias
voltage also causes the output of U1 to be normally LOW in an idle state between commands.  U1's output goes
to COMMUNICATION PCB connecting to a buffer and the output of this buffer connects to the UDI input of
the 6408 Manchester decoder (U3).

13.0  MODE 2 DATA BUS (drawing 148652-100)

This section of the bus transmits the MODE 2 data from the tool to the WTS-CR.  WTS-IB lines MODE 2+
(P4/pin9) and MODE 2- (P4/pin8) are connected to bus coupling transformer T2 (X-1258-B) on the green and
gray wires.

The transformer is also connected to U2 (DS1633 J) through a resistor/diode combination to the brown and
yellow wires.

U2 is a peripheral driver and acts as a current path to ground when active.  The current flows from the +5 V on
the RED wire of T2 through whichever half of the transformer is active.  R6 or R7 and D1 or D2 act as current
limiting and protection for which ever side of the driver chip is active.

The inputs of U2 are connected to output drivers on COMMUNICATION PCB.  The inputs of these drivers are
connected to the outputs BZO
___ and BOO
___ of the 6408 Manchester encoder (U3 on COMMUNICATION PCB).

14.0 MODE 5 DATA BUS (drawing 148652-100)

This section of the bus transmits MODE 5 data from the tool to the WTS-CR.  WTS-IB lines MODE 5+
(P4/pin11) and MODE 5- (P4/pin10) are connected to bus-coupling transformer T3 (X-1258) on the green and
gray wires.  The transformer is also connected to U3 (DS1633 J) through a resistor/diode combination to the
brown and yellow wires.

U3 is a peripheral driver and acts as a current path to ground when active.  The current flows from the +5 V on
RED wire of T3 through whichever half of the transformer is active.  R8 or R9 and D3 or D4 act as current
limiting and protection for which ever side of the driver chip is active.  The inputs of U3 are connected to
output drivers on COMMUNICATION PCB.

The inputs of these drivers are connected to the outputs BZO

15.0 DOWNHOLE POWER SUPPLY  (drawing 150336-100)

The downhole power supply is an AC/DC power supply that provides the regulated voltages needed to power
the instrument.

When powered with AC, 180 V is applied through Wireline 1 and Wireline 4 to the primary of transformer T2.
The output of the transformer is rectified and filtered by BR1 C9 & C10.  The voltage should be close to 150 V
at the input of L1.  An auxiliary winding in T2 energizes the coil of K1 and disconnects AC Mtr Pwr, +DC Mtr
Pwr and -DC Mtr Pwr from the tool.

L1, R4, C7 and C8 provide a smooth voltage to the input of the single-transformer, square wave power
oscillator converter.  This circuit (called a Royer Oscillator) has the input wave drive arrive from a feedback
winding on main power transformer T1.  The heart of this circuit is the square magnetic hysteresis loop
transformer core, which determines the operating frequency.  The different output windings of the transformer
are attached to full wave rectifiers and filter capacitors C1, C2 and C3.  IC1, IC2 and IC3 are series-pass, fixed
output, voltage regulators that provide the +5 V, +15 V and -15 V required by the tool.

A non regulated voltage, the input to IC2, is also present at the output of the power supply.  This output is
required by T2 COMMUNICATION PCB to generate a reference voltage, needed by DAC."

1330XA-GR-AMO,Brief Description of Service - 1.0 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE,"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
The 1330 XA 175 C No-Flask WTS Gamma Ray (GR) tool is compatible with the WTS AC
power and Instrument bus communication protocols on Mode 2 and 5.
As with other G/R detectors, hardware consists of a detecting crystal, coupled to a
photomultiplier (PM) tube. Gamma rays from the formation enter the crystal where they
ionize and give off energy. This ionization energy is converted into tiny flashes of light
(photons). These photons are changed into electrical pulses that are amplified through a series
of dynodes in the PM tube.
Voltage variations from the tube are proportional to the energy of the incident gamma rays.
Since different levels of gamma radiation (i.e., count rates) are associated with different types
of rock, the information from the detector can be used to indicate formation lithology. Higher
gamma ray count rates are commonly associated with the presence of shale.
The tool counts the number of PMT pulses acquired between acquisition commands and
keeps track of the elapsed time in milliseconds within the downhole processor.
Internal circuit board temperature and PMT high voltage measurement are also returned to
the surface as diagnostic parameters.
The electronics are fashioned after previous GR instruments, beginning with detecting the
pulses from the photomultiplier tube, sending them through a discriminator circuit, and then
to a counter where data can be ultimately sent to the surface.
The 1330 XA uses a microprocessor to handle the counts, A/D conversion, high voltage gain
control, elapsed time measurement, temperature measurement, and communications with the
surface.

1330XA-GR-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.1 MICROPROCESSOR............................................................................................3,"MICROPROCESSOR
The heart of the Gamma Ray PC board is the microprocessor, U3, which controls all of
the action of the circuit. This unique microprocessor contains several counters, an A/D
converter, and inputs/outputs necessary to handle communications. It also has internal
ROM that contains processing firmware and internal RAM for holding data.
Support devices of the microprocessor are:
•
Y1 – a 12 MHz oscillator,
•
U9 – flash memory for holding tool parameters,
•
U4 – a precision voltage reference for the A/D converter, and
•
U6 – FPGA implementing Manchester Encoder/Decoder functions."
1330XA-GR-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.2 COMMUNICATIONS.............................................................................................3,"COMMUNICATIONS
Communications with surface equipment is accomplished using Manchester words.
The Instrument Bus (IB) carries commands for all tools of the tool string. Only when a
command contains the correct address for a given tool does it respond. Commands enter
the gamma ray PC board on pins 8 and 9 of connector J1. Commands are transformer-
coupled (T2) to the differential receiver U8. The circuit between T2 and U8 level-shifts
the common mode and amplitude of the received signal to the input range specified by
the datasheet of U8. The output of U8 connects to the UDI input of FPGA U6. Decoding
commands, the FPGA determines whether the word is valid, and if so, updates internal
registers to reflect that a valid word is present. The microcontroller polls this register
status and reads the 16-bit word from the FPGA. Firmware in the microcontroller
determines if the address of the command matches its address and responds appropriately
to the command.
If answering that command requires sending data back to the surface, the microprocessor
writes data to the FPGA registers over the 8-bit data bus. The data word is encoded into
Manchester format, it is clocked out the BZO\ and BOO\ outputs to driver chip U5 (mode
2) or U7 (mode 5). This chip drives MOSFETS that are connected to transformer T1 for
mode 2 or T3 for mode 5. These transformers directly drive the IB (instrument bus). The
IB data lines are tied to connector J1, pins 3 and 4 for mode 2, and pins 11 and 12 for
mode 5.
Data Subset 0 and Subset 1 transmit GR counts, elapsed time (ms), HV measured, and
temperature. Subset 0 is transmitted on mode 2 and Subset 1 is transmitted on mode 5.
Data Subsets 2 and 3 are reduced subsets and transmit only GR counts and elapsed time.
No checksum or header information is added to these subsets. (Only two words are sent.)
Subset 2 is transmitted on Mode 2 and Subset 3 is transmitted on mode 5.

Pulses from the PM tube enter the GR circuit at terminal E8 and are capacitor-coupled
from its high-voltage source to the input of amplifier U10. Calibrating terminals E14 and
E15 are used to adjust the signal strength to give a 2 V peak at TP1 when a Cesium 137
source is brought near to the detector. Once the resistance value is found a leaded resistor
is soldered between these terminals.
The amplified pulses are then sent to discriminator U11 to eliminate base noise and shape
the valid pulses into a square-wave signal. It is the output of U11 that is coupled to an
internal counter of microprocessor U3. Here the pulse count accumulates until the
acquisition cycle stops counting. A free running, millisecond timer reports the elapsed
time between acquisition commands from the surface. Both the elapsed timer and the GR
counter are reset after each acquisition."
1330XA-GR-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.4 GAIN STABILIZATION ..........................................................................................4,"GAIN STABILIZATION
During actual operation, increased downhole temperatures cause the gain of the
photomultiplier tube to decrease. This drop in gain must be corrected to keep the detector
sensitivity to gamma rays constant. This correction is accomplished by increasing the
high voltage applied to the PM tube in a quantity that is proportional to the temperature
change. Two relationships – gain vs temperature, and gain vs high-voltage – are
characteristic of a particular tube type and stabilize the gain by means of a control loop.
Below is a discussion of the various parts of this loop.
2.4.1 Temperature Sensing
U4 contains a high precision voltage reference circuit. However, it also contains a circuit
that compensates the voltage output with variations in temperature. The output of this
circuit is available as a voltage that is proportional to the absolute temperature (°K) that it
senses. This voltage is amplified at U2 A and becomes a signal that is measured by an
input of the microprocessor’s internal A/D converter. Firmware within the
microprocessor handles the processing of the data. Eventually this data is sent to the
surface as part of Subset 0.

1330 XA 175 C No-Flask WTS Gamma Ray – Circuit Descriptions
2.4.2 High Voltage Monitor
The next stage of the control loop monitors the high voltage. This stage consists of
amplifier U2 B and associated components. The amplifier ties to the lower end of the
resistive voltage divider network that biases the dynodes (also the PM tube cathode
connection) and has a gain of 11. The output of this amplifier is fed into one of the inputs
of the A/D converter internal to the microprocessor. Capacitor C28 provides low
impedance to the A/D converter input.
2.4.3 High Voltage Control
The High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS) is a commercial item that is housed in modular
fashion. It has an input pin that allows circuitry to control the output voltage level. The
HV output is inversely proportional to the voltage applied to this control input.
The HVPS control signal is derived from a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) output of the
microprocessor. The average value of the pulse train is amplified by U1. The amplifier
output connects through resistor R3 to terminal E5, which ties to the control pin of the
HVPS.
The microprocessor uses the measured temperature to determine the proper value of the
high voltage for that temperature. The high voltage set points, required for a given
temperature, are listed in a lookup table that resides in the firmware. This set point is
compared to the measured HV value and a PWM correction amount is calculated. The
PWM correction amount to fully adjust the HV to its set point value is divided by two
before it is applied to the PWM. This is done to reduce the speed of the correction and
prevent the possibility of overshoot. This process repeats every 500 ms.
In addition there is a slew rate limit imposed on the HV adjustment to reduce the
maximum step size of the HV, if the set point is far from the measured value.
2.4.4 Start-Up
When the tool is powered up at high temperatures (i.e. downhole) the initialization
portion of the downhole software applies an approximate initial value to the PWM
circuitry to provide for a fast turn-on. The control loop described in the previous
paragraph takes over from this point to keep the system gain stabilized."
1330XA-GR-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.5 HV ON / OFF.........................................................................................................5,"HV ON / OFF5

HV ON / OFF
The PMT high voltage can be turned off via a command from the surface. This command
opens a relay (K2) that disconnects the HVPS input power. This feature was implemented
to reduce the stress on the PMT when gamma measurements were not needed.

POWER SUPPLY PCBA
The Power Supply PCBA (A3001593000) supplies a regulated output voltage of 3.3 Vdc
from an onboard linear regulator. This voltage is for the digital circuitry and is available
at pin 20 of the P2 connector. Digital ground for this regulated voltage is available on pin
19 of P2.
Regulated +12 volts is available on pin 14 of P2 and –12 volts is available on pin 16 of
P2. The voltage regulators are Micropac TO-3 packaged voltage regulators. These
regulators are mounted directly to the chassis for heat-sinking. The PCBA supplies
rectified raw input voltage to these regulators on pins 1 and 12 of P2. Diodes D11 and
D12 protect the Micropac linear regulators from being reverse biased. Analog ground is
common to +12 and -12 V and is available on pin 18 of P2.
Analog ground and digital ground are isolated from each other by the secondary windings
on the AC transformer.
Refer to the schematic drawing A3001593 SCH during the following discussions.
The +3.3 V regulator is a linear regulator that employs a NPN transistor Q1 as a pass
element. U1 provides a voltage reference of 2.5 V for the error amp U2. U2 compares the
output voltage sampled between R5 and R6 to the 2.5 V reference to determine the
amount of drive needed at the base of Q1 to provide 3.3 V at the output. Components Q2,
R10 and R3 provide a current limit circuit. When the output is shorted or overloaded, the
current increases to approximately 300 mA and develops 0.6 V across R3. This voltage
turns on PNP transistor Q2, which shunts drive current from the base of Q1 and attempts
to turn it off. In this condition, the output current is clamped at ~300 mA until the fault is
cleared or the overload condition subsides. Diodes D5 and D10 prevent reverse biasing of
Q1 and Q2.

CONTINUITY AND RESISTANCE CHECKS
Perform all insulation checks with a Megger. Perform all continuity checks with the DMM
set in the relative (REL) mode. The REL setting will null the resistance of the test leads. After
deducting test-lead resistance, continuity is defined as ≤ 1.0 Ω. Open is defined as ≥ 40 MΩ.
Refer to assembly drawing A3001562000 and wiring diagram A3001561 WRD while making
the following checks.
1.
Use a Megger to verify insulation between the top 32-socket WTS connector (J1)
sockets and chassis, and the bottom 32-pin WTS connector (J3) pins and chassis as
follows.

6.2.1
HIGH VOLTAGE CHECK AND GAIN ADJUSTMENT
Any individual(s) directly handling nuclear sources must be fully qualified and
thoroughly familiar with the RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY procedures.
Build Variable Resistor
If you do not have an assembled variable resistor, build one at this time.
1.
Cut two 2.0-inch 20-gauge wires and solder them to the variable resistor (P/N
N730-000-700) as shown in Figure 6. Slide a piece of 0.125-inch shrink tubing
over each solder connections and shrink in place. Do not use another type (part
number) of variable resistor or use wires lengths longer than 2.0-inches. DO NOT
twist wires.



2.
Solder the free-wire ends to clip leads. See Figure 6.
3.
Connect a DMM to the clip leads and use a small screwdriver to adjust the
resistance of the variable resistor to ~50 kΩ. Set aside the assembled variable
resistor until needed.

6.2.2
High Voltage Check and Gain Adjustment
All tests performed in this section will be performed on the gamma ray PCBA
(A3001033000). Normally, gain adjustments are done on aged PM tubes and crystals, or
after replacing the PM tube and crystal.
Keep all unauthorized personnel away. Only the person directly involved with
source handling should be in the immediate area. All other personnel remain clear.
Post the appropriate warning signs.
1.
Connect the J6 connector.
2.
Turn on power to the tool and allow voltage to stabilize (~10 seconds)
3.
Use a high-voltage probe to verify that the voltage measured between E7 (HV) and
E9 (AGND) is 1,360 Vdc ±10 Vdc.
4.
Turn off tool power.
5.
Set up the oscilloscope as shown in Figure 7 and as follows:
•
set trigger to channel 1, -1 Vdc, negative edge, normal mode
•
set channel 1 for 1 V/div and 1 µs/div,
•
and set scope in infinite persistence mode (may be called analog persistence on
some digital scopes).

6.
Connect the channel 1 scope probe to TP1 (E12) and the ground probe to E13 on
the gamma ray PCBA.
7.
Turn off all other scope channels.
8.
Turn on tool power.
9.
Place a cesium-137 lab source (145920-004) close to the center of the scintillation
crystal (~8.5-inches from the bottom end of the downhole snorkel [8,
A3001562000]).
10.
Clear analog persistence traces.
11.
After 10 to 20 seconds the scope display should show a well defined band amongst
the background scatter as shown in Figure 7. This is the cesium peak. Use the
center of this band as your measure point for the rest of this procedure.
12.
Adjust channel 1 level so that the voltage before the pulse is even with a division
line. The cesium peak should be two divisions below the baseline (peak amplitude
of 2 V).
13.
Use the following gain adjustment procedure to adjust the gain if the cesium peak
is less than 1.8 V in amplitude.

Note: If the peak is greater than 2.4 V, determine the cause and repair before proceeding.


A. Remove the resistor currently installed between terminals E14 and E15 of the
gamma ray PCBA.
B. Connect the variable resistor between terminals E14 and E15 of the gamma ray
PCBA as shown in Figure 8.
C. Clear the persistence traces periodically after making gain adjustments, or if
the screen gets cluttered. Wait 10 to 20 seconds for traces to become well
defined as shown in Figure 7.
D. While monitoring the scope, adjust the variable resistor with a small
screwdriver until the center of the cesium peak is 2.0 volts.

Note: This is a multi-turn potentiometer, so its response will be slow. Turn the adjusting screw
clockwise to decrease the pulse height and counterclockwise to increase the pulse height.


14.
Once the cesium peak is adjusted to 2.0 volts, turn off tool power and remove the
variable resistor from the gamma ray PCBA.

1424 XA/XB SEGMENTED BOND TOOL -- DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
P/N 130363-936
JUNE 1998

INTRODUCTION
The 1424 Segmented Bond Tool (SBT), used with the 1633 EA Acoustic Electronics, is a unique cement
bond logging tool.  The SBT can find and define channels in the cement annulus which could result in a poor
hydraulic seal.  Conversely, the SBT can reliably find zones of uniform bonding over only a few feet of
casing.  Under conditions where a short bonded interval produces an adequate hydraulic seal, unnecessary
squeeze jobs can be avoided.
The SBT quantitatively measures the quality of the cement bond in six angular segments around the casing. 
The tool utilizes acoustic transducers mounted on six pads to make  compensated acoustic attenuation
measurements which are not affected by mud weight, gas cut, fast formation effects, casing surface conditions
or moderate tool excentering.  
The six angular measurements made over casing sectors allow one to distinguish clearly between two
situations:
-
a strong cement bond over a portion of the casing circumference resulting in hydraulic communication
between zones
-or-
-
a moderately strong cement bond completely around the casing resulting in a good hydraulic seal.
Conventional bond tools or bond tools which rely on point measurements yield ambiguous results in this
regard.  (See Figure 936-1.)  Since the measurement is quantitative,  conventional interpretative procedures
can be directly applied to the data.

TOOL CONFIGURATION
The attenuation of sound along the casing has long been used as a reliable indication of cement-to-casing
bond.  The SBT utilizes sonic transducers mounted on six pads to make a compensated measurement of the
bond condition in six azimuthal segments around the casing.  Because the transducers are mounted on pads,
the measurement is unaffected by gas in the borehole, fast formations, or heavy mud conditions.  Exact
centering is not required.  Figure 936-2 shows the pad configuration unfolded.
A separate unit provides a ""steered-beam"" VDL.  Two transmitters, one fired immediately after the other,
enhance the amount of energy available (in the direction of the receiver) to produce a better definition of
pipe-to-cement and cement-to-formation interface.  Hence interpretation of the VDL is easier.
Two accelerometers determine the low point of the well.  If the tool is perfectly vertical the reading is
ambiguous, but this seldom happens.  If the deviation is 1 degree, the orientation can be determined to within

STEERED TRANSDUCERS
The SBT employs ""steered"" acoustic transducers techniques to enhance the sound output of both the pad
transmitters and the VDL transmitter.  
The sound power a transducer can radiate is directly proportional to the area of the transducer; bigger
transducers put out more sound.  If, on the other hand, a transducer dimension is larger than 1/4 wavelength
at the frequency of interest, the radiation pattern of the transducer is no longer ommidirectional and it may not
put out an adequate sound level in the direction required.
A way to increase the sound output and at the same time control the directional characteristics of the
transducer is to use two transmitting elements, each 1/4 wavelength long.  In operation,  the first element
furthest from the desired sound is fired.  The second element is fired when the sound from the first element
passes the second element.  The sound is reinforced in the desired direction.  (See Figure 936-3.)  Because the
sound intensity varies as the square of the amplitude, the effective sound power is increase by a factor of four.
The VDL is particularly enhanced by this technique.  Interpretation of the VDL is simplified.  VDL are often

FIGURE 936-3; Sound Reinforcement with Two Transmitting Elements

COMPENSATED MEASUREMENT
The attenuation in each segment is measured in two directions using a pair of acoustic receivers and two
transmitters.  The two measurements are combined to form a compensated result which does not depend on
the receiver sensitivities or transmitter output power.  The attenuation measurement has a dynamic range of
22 dB/ft and is fully compensated over the entire range.
5
SPREADING LOSSES 
Because of the geometry of the transducer arrangement, the sound level at the near receiver is higher than the
level at the far receiver even if there is no attenuation.  As shown in Figure 936-5, the acoustic power present
at cross sections A and B is the same, but since B has a larger area the acoustic intensity or power per unit
area is smaller at B than at A.  This effect is called spreading loss and is a consequence only of the geometry
of the tool.  This effect is removed mathematically from the measurement before the attenuations are
presented.
The SBT is controlled by the 1633 EA Common Acoustic Cartridge.  The downhole computer and digital
telemetry system within the 1633 EA ensures that the data is unaffected by the wireline.  Any of the
waveforms can be digitized downhole and displayed at the surface.
The SBT is 3-3/8 inches in diameter, and can run at 350 F and 20,000 psi.  Casings between 4-1/2 and 16
o
inches can be logged.  Deviations to 90 degrees have been logged.

SEGMENTED BOND TOOL
The 1424 Segmented Bond Tool is housed in a 3.38-diameter, 18-foot mandrel.  Six pairs of articulated arms
hold the pads that contain the acoustic transducers.  Springs at each end of the arms lift the pads and press
them against the casing wall.  A DC  motor located at the downhole end of the mandrel actuates a pull rod that
opens and closes the tool.  
A fluid-to-air bulkhead sub connects the pad section to the electronics section.  The electronics chassis is
mounted onto the bulkhead.   A second bulkhead sub connects the pad section to the motor section.
The SBT is designed to operate in casing from 4.5 to 16 inches in diameter.  The tool body and housings are
constructed of titanium.  A Shear Screw connects the center portion of the mandrel to the bottom of the tool. 
In the event the tool gets stuck in the casing, shearing this screw causes the arms to collapse.  Pulling the
wireline with a force exceeding the strength of the Shear Screw snaps the screw, allowing the arms to close and
frees the tool.
The top and bottom field joints are WTS 32-pin connectors, but only nine conductors are available at the
bottom joint.  Five of these wires drive the VDL sub; the remaining four were provided in the event some

1424 PA VDL SUB FOR 1424 SBT
The VDL Sub (PN 130401) for the SBT is 3.38 inches in diameter and 8 feet long.
The acoustic transducers (receiver and transmitters) are housed inside thin wall cylinders and spaced 5 feet
apart. The transducer housings are connected by a wire tube. 
The tool is oil filled and pressure compensated by a floating piston, located between the receiver and
transmitters.  The top and bottom tool joints are WTS compatible (32-pin connectors). A slotted housing
protects the transmitters/receiver assembly.
The VDL sub is designed to work exclusively with the Segmented Bond tool."

INTRODUCTION
The upper head of the Segmented Bond Tool is a standard 32-pin WTS connector designed to connect
only to the 1633 Common Acoustic Cartridge.

The SBT has only two outputs--UREC and LREC--which connect to the A/D converters of the 1633
Common Cartridge. The UREC line carries the analog output of the upper pad receivers of the tool.
The LREC is a misnomer in that, in addition to the lower pad receiver signals, the VDL and X and Y
Accelerometer signals are also multiplexed on this line.

A digital data line, a clock line, and a latch line serially transfer digital data to the SBT from the
Common Cartridge. An additional line allows firing of the SBT transmitters by the Common Cartridge.
These are further explained below.

The wireline passes through a choke in the Common Cartridge to prevent any interference to the
telemetry communication by the tools below the common. This line, termed ""filtered 150"" or 150 VF,
is used in the SBT and passed through to the bottom of the SBT for use by tools below the SBT.

Two WTS, PCM communication lines are also routed through the tool for control of tools below the
SBT.

Seven circuit boards are employed in the SBT. These are described in the following paragraphs.
The descriptions are intended to be used together with the circuit diagrams included in FIELD
REFERENCE DRAWINGS AND BILL OF MATERIALS P/N 130363-975 or 130627-975"
1424-SBT-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 2.0 POWER SUPPLY BOARD P/N 142765-000,"POWER SUPPLY BOARD P/N 142765-000

The power supply board converts the 150 V filtered line voltage to 300 volts for the transmitters and a
regulated 5, 15 and -15 volts for the SBT electronics.
When the power supply is first turned on, FET Q3 is on supplying 7-10 volts to buffer U1 and Flip-Flop U2.
A section of the buffer, R3, and C4 form an 80-kHz oscillator. The Flip-Flop divides the frequency by two
and produces two symmetrical, out-of-phase square waves at U2-1 and U2-2. These voltages drive the push-
pull power circuit (Q1 and Q2) producing a 300-volt square wave at their drains.

The bridge CR3-CR6 supplies ±18 volts to voltage regulators U3 and U4. The secondary of the supply is
floating at analog ground. If the board is being checked out when disconnected from the tool, care must be
taken to ground the AGND terminal. +5 V is regulated down by VR1 from voltage divider formed with R13
and R14.

When the output voltages are established, the +15 volts is feedback via CR8 to supply U1 and U2. The -15
volts via R12 turns off FET Q3 and prevents power dissipation in R13.

The transformer is used as an auto-transformer to generate the 300 volts (150-volt line voltage plus a 150
volt boost). CR1, CR2, C1, C2, and R2 shape the waveform and suppress spikes.

R1 and L1 keep the switching voltage off the 150-volt line and hence provide noise suppression and prevent
interference with the telemetry system.

CR9 disconnects the supply if the line voltage is negative."

CAPACITOR BOARD P/N 148434-000

The capacitor board contains the two firing capacitors for the ""now"" and ""delayed"" VDL transmitters.
C1 A, B, C, D are wired in parallel to collectively form a 2-µF cap for the ""now"" transmitter. Similarly
C2 A, B, C, D are used for the delayed transmitter. These capacitors are charged from the 300-volt
supplies via R1 and R2 and are discharged at the firings.

R3 and R4 are the charging resistors for Pad firing caps C3 and C4 (which are two 1-µF tubular caps,
mounted on the chassis)."

PREAMPLIFIERS

The receiver board has seven identical preamplifiers. These are hybrid, balanced input, instrumentation
opamps configured for a gain of 20. The coupling cap and resistor at their output provides a low
frequency roll-off at 15 kHz.

Preamplifiers U2, U3, U4 are used for the three upper pad receivers. One of these is selected by the analog
switch U5. This output is filtered by the two-pole 110-kHz filter (U13 A) and buffered by U13 B to provide
the upper pad receiver output UREC to the Common Cartridge. The total gain from input to output of the
receiver board is 100. The 15-volt logic levels require at U5 to select each of the receivers is shown on
identical to that of the upper pad receivers except that the output is fed to the multiplexer U12 instead of
being sent directly to the Common Cartridge.

Preamplifier U1 is used for the VDL receiver. The output is rolled off at about 30 kHz by the amplifier
U10 A and additional high-pass filtering is provided by U10 B to prevent road noise from interfering with
the VDL signal. The output of U10 is also routed to the U12 multiplexer."
1424-SBT-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 4.2 MULTIPLEXERS,"MULTIPLEXERS

Multiplexer U16 is used to either route the output of the X and Y accelerometers to U17 or to short the
inputs of U17 to ground for calibration purposes. U17 A and B, in combination with C3 and C4 mounted
on the chassis, integrate (low-pass filter) the outputs of the accelerometers. The integration time is about
0.1 seconds.

The LREC multiplexer (U12) is used to select:
(1)
the VDL,
(2)
a lower pad receiver,
(3)
or one of the accelerometer channels

to send to the Common Cartridge."
1424-SBT-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 4.3 SHIFT REGISTERS,"SHIFT REGISTERS

The logic code is received from the Common Cartridge via U14 and U15. The input data (D IN) read
into these two shift registers at each clock pulse (CLK). When 16 bits have been shifted in, the Latch line
is pulsed by the Common Cartridge and the bits are latched. This process is repeated for each firing and
at each read of the accelerometers."

U15 also decodes the three bits (SEL0, SEL1 or SEL2) used to select: 1) one of 6 pad transmitters,
2) the VDL transmitter, or 3) no transmitter. The resistor network is provided to reduce the levels to
5 volt for the transmitter board and to provide places to short these bits to ground for test purposes.

Motor control signals M0 and M1 are also supplied by U15. These signals must be held in a disabled
state during initial power on, or when the 1633 EA cartridge is not connected to the tool. U18 disables
the outputs of U15 (selects tri-state high impedance output) when the 1633 EA is not connected to the
SBT, or during initial power on (LATCH from the 1633 EA is high during the first five to seven
seconds on power on)

A complete logic chart is shown in Figure 945-1.


VDL TRANSDUCER DRIVER BOARD P/N 148793-000

The VDL driver board has two identical high-level output circuits consisting of FET's Q2 and Q4 and
their respective drivers Q1 and Q3. In operation, the VDL capacitors located on the capacitor board are
discharged through Q2 or Q4 and the transducer transformers to provide the 300-volt pulses necessary
to drive the VDL transformers (VDL PRIM HI NOW and VDL PRIM HI DLY).

The input fire pulse for the VDL transmitter is routed to one-shot delay U2, which produces the 25-µs
pulse width necessary to drive the ""now"" element of the VDL transducer (XDUCER).

The input fire pulse also goes to another one-shot (U3) which generates the delayed fire pulse. After the
12µs delay, the second half of U3 generates the 25-µs pulse required to drive the ""delayed"" element of the
VDL transducer."

Resistors (R7 and R9) and test points (VDL-N and VDL-D) are provided to allow shorting either the
""now"" or the ""delayed"" pulse for test purposes. The VDL output should drop at least 30% when either
is shorted.

Also located on this board are the one-shots (U1 and a section of U2) that produce the 5-µs pulses for
both the ""now"" and delayed pad transducers (PAD NOW PLS and PAD DLY PLS)."
1424-SBT-AMO,Circuit Descriptions - 6.0 PAD TRANSDUCER DRIVER BOARD P/N 148794-000,"PAD TRANSDUCER DRIVER BOARD P/N 148794-000

The Pad Transducer Driver board contains twelve identical high-level driver circuits to drive both the
inner and outer (""delayed"" and ""now"") transducer stacks on each of the six pads. The circuits are arranged
so that the 300 VDC, used to charge Pad Transmitter capacitors C2 and C1 (mounted on the chassis), is
not constantly on the wiring which must be in the mud. The high-level FET's (the IRF740) are each driven
by the lower level FET's (the IRFD120's) through coupling transformers.

Two 3-to-8 decoder chips (U1 and U2) select the transmitter by decoding SEL0, SEL1, and SEL2 (XMSO,
XMS1, XMS2). One chip is used for the ""now"" transmitter and the other for the ""delayed"" transmitter. The
output of these chips is enabled for 5 µs each firing by the PAD NOW PULSE and the PAD DLY PULSE
from the VDL driver board. Figure 945-1 shows the logic for the decoder chips. Basically the chips select:
1) one of the six pads, 2) the VDL transmitter, or 3) no transmitter.

Resistors R2 and R3 and test points PAD-N and PAD-D are provided to allow shorting the fire pulses for
testing purposes.

MOTOR CONTROL BOARDS P/N 154444-000 & P/N 154445-000

The motor control boards have two virtually identical circuits consisting of three FETS to control the
application of power and ground to the motor. Circuit board 1 (P/N 154444-000) contains the additional
logic to prevent both the open and close control signals from becoming active (high) at the same time.
When signals M0 and M1 are both low (ground), the output pins 3 and 4 of IC1 are both low. When
signals M0 and M1 are both high, output pins 3 and 4 of IC1 are both low. Diodes D8 and D9 insure that
one of the control lines (M0 or M1) must be low before allowing a high output from either IC1-4 or IC1-3.

A high signal on IC1-4 will allow Q3 to conduct to supply ground through switch S1 to the MOT2
connection of the motor. The same high signal from IC1-4 is delayed about 2 millisecond by R4 & C2
before applying the 150 V power through Q1 to the MOT1 connection of the motor. The motor will now
run until the upper limit switch S1 is opened.

The motor control circuits should be returned to the idle or neutral state before sending a close command
to the tool. When the close command is issued, IC1-3 goes high. This signal is connected to Motor Control
Board 2 (P/N 154445-000) and controls the FETS Q4, Q5, and Q6 just as the open signal controlled the
FETS Q1, Q2, and Q3 on board one. Diode D1 protects the board from havings a negative voltage applied
to it. D2 zener supplies the 15 volt reference for the M0 and M1 input logic circuits.

The motor circuits can be operated from a motor control box (P/N 154455-000) plugged into the tool
downhole connector as long as the 1633 EA common is not connected to the tool at the same time. The motor
control box supplies the 150 VDC Power and applies ground to the control line it does not want to activated.
This is done because without the 1633 EA connected the shift register output on the receiver board is in the
tri-state output condition. The control lines M0 and M1 are both high impedance outputs."

FINAL ASSEMBLY OPERATION

For the following (unless otherwise stated), refer to drawings R149158 and C149160.

1.
Finish wiring the tool according to schematic drawing C149160.  Connect the wires to their respective
feed-thru terminals at the top and bottom bulkheads.

2.
Install wire covers [13] and [14] into the slots of upper and lower slotted housings.

3.
After the tool is wired a check on the adjustments of the motor limit switches must be made.  The tool
can be controlled via the PCM test system or by a motor control box from the bottom of the tool.  Adjust
the microswitch actuator pins as follows:

CAUTION
PERFORM THIS OPERATION VERY CAREFULLY TO PREVENT ANY
DAMAGE TO THE LINKAGES OR MOTOR DRIVE PARTS.

-
Motor the tool until the arms are fully closed.  Move the pin until the microswitch is actuated.
Microswitch must be actuated as soon as the pads are closed.

-

the arm and pin at this time.  Do this for all six assemblies.  Take care not to damage the wires.
3.
(Refer to Dwg. C-149160) Note:  When installing boots over pressure terminals, fill the boot with
silicone grease to ensure no air is trapped inside the boot.  Install boots and connectors on one end of a
3-conductor cable and on one end of the 2-conductor cable.  Plug them into the three pressure terminals
located on the transmitter side, and the 2 pressure terminals located on the receiver side.  (Figure 955-
43.)  Do this for the three identical assemblies.  Refer to Figure 955-44 for the other three assemblies.




1424 XA/XB SEGMENTED BOND TOOL -- DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES


4.
The arm cover [48] can now be installed.  Make sure there is enough of a loop
between the arm [20] and transducer housing [24] so that the wire is never
under strain.  Once this has been achieved, fasten the arm cover [48] using
spacers [52] and the flat head screws [49] and Loctite [39].  (Figure 955-45.)
The spacers insure that the arm cover is not pinching the wires.

5.
The wire can now be run out of the arm [20] and thru the top of the link [4].
To install the tunnel [6], position the assembly as shown in Figure 955-46.
Insert the wire into the channels of the tunnel [6] and line up the holes in the
tunnel [6] with the holes in the link [4].  Fasten with flat head screws [47]
using Loctite [39].  Note that with the tunnel installed in the position
mentioned above, the wire can flex when the tool is finally operated.



Before beginning to install, make sure the tool is approximately 3 feet off of the bench, properly
supported and able to turn 360 degrees.

Align the slots in the yokes [14] and washers [7] with the slots in the top slotted housing [16]. The
position for the two sets of the these three pad assemblies will be determined by the flats on the
mandrel [18]. The long flats on the mandrel [18] will house the long side of the transducer
housing [24] and visa versa.

Insert the link part of the assembly into the correct slot and let the wire lay outside for the time being.

Install one transducer assembly arm in upper yoke and one transducer assembly arm in lower yoke.
Depress arm in the upper yoke so pad is in closed position.  The pad should lie in the flats of the
mandrel.  Distance from the end of the mandrel to the end of the arm should be 29 3/8 inches.  Perform
same test on arm in lower yoke.  The distance from end of the mandrel to end of the arm should be 37
3/4 inches.  If arm distances are not correct and the pads do not line up properly in the flats of the
mandrel the tool will not close completely.  The adjustment or setting made in section 3.2-12 will
have to be changed.  Also check the distance between the top of the upper (odd number) pad and
the top of lower (even number) pad.  The distance must be 8 3/8 inches, ± 1/16"".  The distance
should be correct if the assembly of the internal linkage (section 3.2) was correctly performed.

16

1424 XA/XB SEGMENTED BOND TOOL -- DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES



If the adjustment is correct, install the remaining four transducer housings on the tool.  Be sure to
orientate them properly so they will lie in the flats of the mandrel when the tool is closed.  Install the
yoke screw [15], using Loctite to secure the arm assemblies.

The six remaining arm and link assemblies can now be installed into the bottom slotted housing [32].
Align the linkage previously installed in the bottom slotted housing [32] by making sure the 3 slots in
yokes [14] and flanges [5] line up with the 3 slots in the bottom slotted housing [32].  (Figure 955-47.)


[15] by lightly compressing the spring to align hole in arm [20] with hole in yoke [14].  Tighten yoke
screw [15] using loctite [39].  (Figure 955-48.)  Repeat for all the slots in the bottom slotted housing.
Install the large pin [21] into the transducer housing [24] and through the arm [20] until the 0.078-inch
diameter cross hole aligns with the hole on the center of the arm.  Install roll pin [51] through the arm
and pin.  Do this to both ends of all six assemblies.



Thread the electronics bulkhead assembly [1] into the top slotted housing until it shoulders.  Then back
it off until the slot in the threads of the bulkhead aligns with the threaded holes on the top slotted
housing. Install three set screws [8] and tighten with Loctite.

Note
Notice that pad no. 1 Transmitter side is oriented toward the top of the tool.  Pad
no. 1 Wires will run in groove 1 which is stamped on the bulkhead.

17

1424 XA/XB SEGMENTED BOND TOOL -- DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES


8.
Once the bulkhead has been installed, the remaining wire can now be run.
Use the short wire covers [45] for the short slots and the long wire covers [46]
for the long slots in the top slotted housing [16].  Insert the wire into the
channels of the covers.  Make sure that there is enough of a loop between the
tunnel [6] and the cover so the wire can flex freely upon tool operation.
(Figure 955-49).  Fasten the covers with screws [47] using Loctite [39].
Insure that there are no wires pinched under the wire covers when the covers
are screwed down.

9.
NOTE:  These two steps may performed after the final checkout to
insure there are no problems with the tool.  However, a check of all pads
must be made after the covers are installed to insure no wires were
pinched or shorted while mounting the covers.

After routing the wire, the transmitter cover [25] and the receiver cover [26]
can be installed using the flat head screws [23].  Make sure the wire is not
pinched in any way by the covers.  You may have to form the wire as it
exits the transducer housing [24] and goes into the arm [20].  The area
around the pressure terminals should be packed with silicone grease.
(Figure 955-50.) Install the SOC screws [32] to complete the cover mounting.

wire covers [45] for the short slots and the long wire covers [46] for the long slots in the
top slotted housing.

5. Insert the wire into the channels of the covers. Make sure that there is enough of a loop
between the tunnel and the cover so the wire can flex freely upon tool operation.

6. Fasten the covers with screws [47] using Loctite. Ensure there are no wires pinched under
the wire covers when the covers are screwed down.

Note: These two steps may be performed after the final checkout to ensure there
are no problems with the tool. However, a check of all pads must be made
after the covers are installed to ensure no wires were pinched or shorted
while mounting the covers.

7. After routing the wire, install the transmitter cover [25] and the receiver cover [26] using the
flat head screws [23]. Make sure the wire is not pinched in any way by the covers. You
may have to form the wire as it exits the transducer housing and goes into the arm.

For a given coil configuration, this geometric factor is a function of the radius of the loop, and
its position along the axis of the tool.  So we can consider it a 2-dimensional function.  Figure 2
shows this 2-dimensional function for the 2-coil array illustrated in Figure 1.  The ""z"" axis
shows distance along the tool or borehole axis.  The ""r"" axis shows radius or distance from the
tool axis.  As we can see, the system is sensitive to a wide region around the instrument, but the
maximum sensitivity is between the receiver coils and at a radius between a half (½) and one (1)
times the coil spacing.  Note also that there is significant sensitivity close to both the receiver
and transmitter coils.

If we take the geometric factor and integrate or total the values for a given position along the
borehole, this gives the sensitivity of the system to a thin layer of formation at that position.
This is called the Vertical Geometric Factor (VGF) which is illustrated for the DPIL deep and
medium array in Figure 4.
A common definition of vertical resolution is the distance between the 5  and 95  percentiles at

HDIL (High Definition Induction Log) is our next generation induction logging instrument.  It
is a direct competitor to the Schlumberger Array Induction Tool (AIT), and uses multi-spacing
and multi-frequency measurements to acquire a complete set of data from the formations
surrounding the borehole.
The multi-spacing measurements allow improved conductivity measurements in complex
environments.  The short-spacing measurements (as short as 6-inch spacing) allow improved
correction for borehole, rugosity and invasion effects.  The long-spacing measurements (up to
94-inch spacing) are useful in deep invasion situations.  The multiple-frequency measurements
allow for an improved skin-effect correction and data quality checking.
HDIL allows us to characterize invasion profiles, even in oil-based muds.
HDIL is a full feedthrough, WTS tool."

1515-HDIL-AMO,Brief Description Of Service/Equipment - 3.0 THEORY 3.1 GEOMETRIC FACTOR,"THEORY 
GEOMETRIC FACTOR
Key to understanding both the design of induction instruments and the processing of induction
data is the concept of the geometric factor proposed by Doll in 1949.  In geometric factor
theory, we think of the earth being divided into circular ground loops of unit cross-sectional
area coaxial with the tool.  Figure 1 shows this concept graphically for a 2-coil induction
logging system.  An alternating current in the transmitter coil induces a voltage in the ground
loop.  This voltage is 90 degrees out-of-phase with the current in the transmitter.  The voltage
causes an eddy current to flow in the loop proportional in magnitude to the conductivity of the
formation in the loop.  This current induces a voltage in a receiver coil which we can detect.
This voltage is 90 degrees out-of-phase with the voltage and current in the ground loop.
According to this theory, the received voltage is proportional to the conductivity of the
formation in the loop.  The constant of proportionality varies with the radius and position of the
loop along the tool axis, as well as the position and construction of the coils.  This constant of

1515-HDIL-AMO,Brief Description Of Service/Equipment - 3.2 REAL AND QUADRATURE SIGNALS,"REAL AND QUADRATURE SIGNALS
From the above model we can also deduce the received signal has undergone two 90-degree
phase shifts with respect to the current in the transmitter.  It is therefore back in-phase with this
current.  (In fact, it is 180 degrees out-of-phase, but we treat this as in-phase with a sign
change).
We call this in-phase signal the ""Real Signal.""  This phase relationship is convenient because
there is also a signal in the receiver that is coupled directly from the transmitter.  This signal is
large, but unaffected by the formation conductivity.  We call this signal the ""direct-coupled"" or
""Mutual Signal.""  This signal is 90 degrees out-of-phase with the transmitter current, so we can
separate it from the desired in-phase signal by using phase-sensitive detection.
There is also a signal which is 90 degrees out-of-phase with the current, which is affected by the
formation conductivity.  We call this the ""Quadrature Signal.""

concentrates its response in a smaller region than a 2-coil array (see Figure 2).  However, there
is still significant sensitivity close to each coil which will lead to a cave effect or undesirable
response at changes in diameter of the borehole.
130551-935"
1515-HDIL-AMO,Brief Description Of Service/Equipment - 3.6 SOFTWARE FOCUSING,"SOFTWARE FOCUSING
It is a fact that, although we can vary the focusing of an induction instrument by modifying the
coil array to achieve greater depth of investigation or resolution, we can do very little to reduce
the cave effect.  There will always be a peak in sensitivity close to nearly every coil.  To reduce
cave effect, and the possible artifacts caused by high contrast in the invaded zone, we will need
to go to software focusing.  In software focusing, the measurements are made by several simple
coil arrays and their signals are combined, in software, to achieve focusing.  The advantage of
this technique is measurements can be combined from arrays at different points in the well.  It is
this fact which enables us to reduce the cave effect.  There is no single ideal focusing scheme.
So, another advantage is different focusing schemes can be used in different circumstances.
The process of focusing is actually applying predesigned filters to the raw signals to achieve a
more desirable 2-D geometric factor for the result.  The steps are as follows.
1.
Apply a predesigned filter to each raw data curve.
2.
Combine these filtered curves to generate a curve with the desired 2-D geometrical
factor.
3.
Repeat the process, with different filters, for each output curve.

curves have less near-borehole sensitivity or cave-effect.

1515-HDIL-AMO,Brief Description Of Service/Equipment - 3.7 BOREHOLE CORRECTION,"BOREHOLE CORRECTION
We have seen that the software focusing process does a great deal towards removing the
borehole effect from the final curves.  However, it is still the case that if we know the borehole
conductivity and size, we can improve the rejection of the borehole signal.  This can be done in
the same way as conventional borehole corrections for induction tools.  Since there are so many
more measurements, however, it is essential this is performed by the software."
1515-HDIL-AMO,Brief Description Of Service/Equipment - 3.8 SKIN EFFECT,"SKIN EFFECT
The above geometric factor theory assumes the response caused by a particular loop of
formation is independent of all other loops of formation, and that the total response can be
found by totaling all of the individual responses.  In fact the signal is attenuated, and delayed,
by conductive formations between the transmitter, the earth loop, and the receiver.  This
attenuation is commonly called the ""skin-effect.""  The consequence of this is that the received
signal is usually less than predicted by the Doll theory, and also the detailed shape of the 2-D
geometric factor changes with conductivity.  To deal with this we apply a form of skin-effect
correction, and we also use a filtering technique called ""adaptive filtering"" which is described in
greater detail later."
1515-HDIL-AMO,Brief Description Of Service/Equipment - 3.9 SKIN-EFFECT CORRECTION,"SKIN-EFFECT CORRECTION
There are various ways to perform the skin-effect correction.
In previous tools, the correction was based on the assumption the tool was in a homogenous
environment.  The relationships then between the true conductivity and the measured
conductivity was fairly well defined and a correction algorithm was defined using just the in-
phase, or real, signal.  This technique presents problems at high conductivities, for instance,
below about one (1) ohm-m, for a 20kHz induction measurement, the results become less
reliable.
Another technique used to some extent in the DPIL is the quadrature curve.  The quadrature
signal, after the direct coupled signal is removed, can be shown to be very closely related to the
skin-effect, and corrections based on the quadrature signal are straight-forward to apply and
overcome the difficulty described above for in-phase only schemes.  The problem is that at low
conductivities, the quadrature signal is unreliable and sensitive to properties other than
conductivity such as magnetic permeability variations.  In the DPIL, we therefore use various
combinations of the in-phase only and quadrature based corrections.
A third technique is based on the observation that skin-effect is also a function of the frequency
of operation.  The rate of change of signal with frequency can also be shown to be closely
related to the skin-effect.  We use this fact to perform skin-effect correction in HDIL.  We
calculate not only the apparent conductivity at each frequency, but also the rate of change of
conductivity with frequency.  This form of correction is similar in performance to the
quadrature based correction, but does not have the same problems at low conductivity.
12
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE/EQUIPMENT — 1515 EA/MA HDIL

ADAPTIVE FILTERING
An undesirable consequence of the skin-effect is the 2-D geometrical factor of each
measurement varies with the conductivity environment.  This means filters designed for a low
conductivity environment will not work in a higher conductivity environment.  For this reason,
several sets of filters are designed for various background conductivities.  The filters are chosen
by first estimating the average conductivity in the region, and then choosing the appropriate
filter set based on this value.  As you can see, with each filter set being as much as 50-feet long,
and with different filter sets for every target response and background conductivity, there are a
large number of filter coefficients to handle.  That is why this is an ""ECLIPS Only Tool."""
1515-HDIL-AMO,Brief Description Of Service/Equipment - 3.10 RESOLUTION MATCHING,"RESOLUTION MATCHING
It can be shown theoretically, and it is also intuitively believable, the deeper into the formation
we try to focus our measurements, the poorer the vertical resolution we can achieve.  This can
be seen by examining the geometric factors in Figure 7.  In each case we have tried to achieve
as ideal a vertical resolution as possible for a given depth of investigation.  We can see the
deeper investigating responses are spread out more and have poorer vertical and radial
resolution.  In a sense, these responses represent the best resolutions which can be achieved
while maintaining low sensitivity to near borehole conductivity.  We call these curves ""true-
resolution"" logs and consider them our basic measurement which we can offer the customer.
However, although true-resolution curves are in many ways the ""best"" measurement, they do
have one undesirable feature.  Because they each have different vertical resolutions, in thin and
even not so thin impermeable beds, they will separate and give the appearance of significant
invasion.  This is illustrated in Figure 9 which shows the true-resolution curves from our test
well.  This well is cased with plastic pipe so, apart from a different conductivity seen by the
shallowest measurement, we would expect all of the other curves to stack and indicate no
invasion.  They do not.  Some customers do not like this and prefer logs which stack in thin,
impermeable zones.
We can satisfy our customers the same way our competitors do by taking high resolution data
from our shallow measurements and adding it to the deeper ones to give the same apparent
vertical resolution.  When we do this we create what we call ""resolution-matched curves,"" and

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE/EQUIPMENT — 1515 EA/MA HDIL

RESOLUTION MATCHING
Remember when we do this we are adding high resolution data from close to the borehole.  We
have not changed our ability to resolve changes in conductivity far from the borehole.  The
average affect of this extra data is negligible near the borehole, so the depth of investigation
does not change.  The full effect can be seen by examining the geometric factors in Figure 10
which are for a resolution-matched curve set.  We see that near the borehole they all have
similar responses, so the high resolution shape of the curves will be the same.  Further from the
borehole we see what is left of the original ""true-res"" responses which give the depth of
investigation in thicker beds where the near-borehole effects cancel out.
There are a few things to be aware of when using the resolution matched curves.
1.
In a thin invaded bed, all curves will respond according to the invaded zone profile.
We cannot measure Rt in a thin invaded bed.
2.
In thicker invaded beds, where for instance the invasion is more conductive than the
shoulder bed and the un-invaded zone is resistive, there is the likelihood of spikes and
other artifacts at the bed boundaries.
3.
We have reintroduced the cave effect.
For this reason the matched resolution curves should be used with caution, and preferably when
caves, and the invasion profiles described above, are not present.

applications.  To select the proper XTF name, the user may also go to the ""File"" menu
of the launched window and choose ""Open XTF file..."".
2)
Select the processing functions.  There are six (6) processing functions: preprocessing
(PREP), skin-effect correction (SEC), borehole correction (BHC), true resolution
filtering (TRF), vertical resolution matching (VRM), and the synthesis of DPIL curves
(SYN).  These functions can be run individually or consecutively.  The order of
processing is: (1) PREP, (2) SEC, (3) BHC, (4) TRF, (5) VRM, and (6) SYN.  It is
suggested to run them together by highlighting all of them.  If the user wants to use any

1515-HDIL-AMO,Analyses Software - 5.0 PROCESSING QUALITY ASSURANCE,"PROCESSING QUALITY ASSURANCE
The processing quality has to be verified according to the induction physics and the
measurement objectives.  Following is a list of suggestions on quality assurance:
!
Check self-consistency among the responses for various subarrays of the same
frequency.  The curves should have ""smooth"" transition from short to long subarrays.
A short subarray has more variations than a long one.
!
Inspect the curves of different frequencies (or spectrum) of the same subarray.  The
curves should be in good order from low to high frequencies.  Usually the higher the
frequency the smaller the apparent conductivity (this is also an indication that the
temperature correction has been applied correctly).  In extremely conductive formation,
the apparent conductivity at the high frequency end might be negative.
!
The resulting curves after skin-effect correction already have quite good correlation
among each other as well as with the true formation conductivity distribution.  These
curves usually have good ""ordering"" from short to long subarrays.
!
During the skin-effect correction, quality control curves are generated to show at each
depth the percentage of misfit between the measured and the predicted apparent
conductivities.  These quality indicators usually have a few percent at most.  In very
resistive or very conductive formations, the percentage could be larger.  These
indicators are for internal use only.
!
The true resolution focused curves should also have good relationship among the
shallow to deep focusing.  A deep one is normally smoother than a shallow one.
!
The vertical resolution matched curves should be examined more carefully.  Usually if
there are high contrast between neighboring layers and/or invasion zone(s), there would
be over enhancement or sometimes even spike in the focused curves.  If it is purely 1 D
(horizontal layers without invasion) and moderate contrast (less than 10's) the curves
should not show any abnormal features.
!
The curves should agree in impermeable zone.  Failure to agree could be improper
borehole correction, calibration or temperature correction.  It is also possible that a
small amount of invasion has occurred which is not detected by normal logging tools.
In permeable zones, the invasion profiles should be reasonable as discussed above.
!
Efforts are made to minimize the spikes and artifacts.  However, in some rare situations,
spikes can be caused by: (1) borehole rugosity at high conductivity contrast between
borehole and formation; (2) deep conductive invasion near bed boundaries; (3) irregular
sampling caused by stick and pull; (4) boundaries of high contrast beds; and (5) large
relative dip."

The real-time log quality control procedure is described in detail in the ECLIPS Operating
procedures.  Quality control on the end product, i.e. focused curves, is an extension of the
normal techniques used for Log Quality Control of resistivity data."
1515-HDIL-AMO,Log Quality Control. - 2.0 FOCUSED RESISTIVITIES,"FOCUSED RESISTIVITIES
The focused conductivities can be checked for agreement with what is expected in the well. That
is:
!
Curves should agree in impermeable zone.  Failure to agree could be improper borehole
correction, calibration or temperature correction.  It is also possible that a small amount
of invasion has occurred which is not detected by normal logging tools.
!
Curves should be free of unexplained spikes and artifacts.  Spikes can be caused by:
-
Borehole rugosity
-
Deep conductive invasion near bed boundaries
-
Stick and Pull
-
High contrast bed boundaries.
-
Large relative dip
NOTE
If the raw data contain, for instance, one isolated bad sample, this will appear on
the focused curves as an anomaly which may be 50 or more feet long, because of the
length of the focusing filters.
!
Invasion profiles should be reasonable in permeable zones."
1515-HDIL-AMO,Log Interpretation - 1.0 LOG DIAGNOSTICS,"LOG DIAGNOSTICS
In the case of a ""problem log,"" that is one with unexpected behavior, ECLIPS provides a
number of ways to examine the tool data in order to help determine the cause of the anomaly.
If the problem is suspected to be in processing, the mitre.diag.log presentation is an excellent
place to begin.  Following are some of the things you can look for in each of the views shown in
These windows show data sent by the tool with very little processing applied, and therefore are
the best place to check that the tool is functioning correctly.  Once characteristic signatures are
familiar, the identification of certain anomalous situations in the tool will become easier in these
windows than after the data have been converted to the frequency domain.
The mitre.wave window has the curves scaled so that their amplitudes are proportional to the
voltages going into the A/Ds.  With the default values (ie, 100% Y scaling), they are scaled
with one (1) volt between each baseline.  This presentation is best when thee are suspected
problems in the digital part of the instrument.
For example, if an A/D stacker is not providing data, the wave form will display -2.048 Volts
for that channel.  Any noise being picked up after the pre-amplifiers would tend to have the
same amplitude on each channel.  However, due to short space channels having loser gain than
the longer channel — They have a wider dynamic range. — the tendency will be to read the
lower amplitudes in a uniform formation.
The mitre.input.wave window is scaled so that the amplitudes are proportional to the voltages
coming out of the coils.  Now the signatures will be about the same amplitude if the tool is in a
uniform formation.  Referring to Figure 984-01, the area under the pulses is proportional to
conductivity so even in this window a uniform progression should be seen, depending upon
whether the borehole is conductive or resistive.  The skin effect can also bee seen, which causes
the pulses to broaden, and this effect should become more pronounced with longer spacings.
The wave windows are not delayed, so features in the well will go past the arrays one-by-one,
beginning with array 6.  By comparison, faults or events within the tool will affect all channels

LOG INTERPRETATION — 1515 EA/MA HDIL
130551-984"
1515-HDIL-AMO,Log Interpretation - 3.0 SPECTRUM WINDOW,"SPECTRUM WINDOW
In this window, expect to see the following:
!
All curves decreasing as frequency increases, especially on longer spacings.  The
shorter spacings will normally appear almost horizontal.
!
Excessive curvature of curves at low frequencies and shorter spacings may indicate a
calibration or temperature correction problem.  The 10 and 30kHz curves are not
normally very good on the short spacings, and are not used.  However, they are good
diagnostic values since they are often the first ones to go wrong if there is a problem.
!
At very low conductivities (< 20mS/m), noise and other errors may cause spectra to
have abnormal shapes.
!
Smooth variation from channel to channel.
!
This windows is also the most obvious place to see the notorious 90kHz noise exists.  If
it is restricted to channel 6 at 90kHz, the log should be alright.  If it is bleeding over
into other frequencies or channels, the log may be noisy and show poor curve
agreement.
!
If glitches or erratic behavior is seen in the spectrum window which cannot be seen in
the wave windows, suspect the temperature measurement.  If RXTEMP is misbehaving,
record the log with the temperature correction OFF.  The shallow curves will read too
low conductivity, but the deep measurements have almost no temperature effect so they
can still be used."
1515-HDIL-AMO,Log Interpretation - 4.0 MITRE.DIAG.LOG,"MITRE.DIAG.LOG
This is probably the most useful presentation for diagnosing a problem log.  It displays the skin-
effect corrected curves (msecA).  If these look good, the tool is functioning correctly.  It shows
the borehole effect corrected curves (mbhcA), allowing the borehole correction to be checked
and parameters adjusted if necessary.  It also shows the true resolution focused curves (mOrD
and mOcD) in order to check whether the focusing is the source of the problem.  Displayed are
all three types of curves on a linear scale.  This makes it easier to distinguish between offset
type errors and real spikes.  An offset can shift a curve towards zero or even negative.  This will
appear as a spike when the linear scale is also the best way to examine borehole corrections
since they are approximate shifts.
The skin-effect corrected curves should be free of excessive noise or spikes.  They should be in
a reasonable order, that is, there should be a smooth progression from array to array.  These
curves are uncorrected so the order should reflect the borehole conductivity or invasion profile
and deeper curves may have shoulder-bed effect.  At this stage they should have no negative
values except momentarily if there are conductive wash-outs.
Once the borehole correction is applied, arrays 0, 1 and 2 are expected to read approximately
the same since they are each reading the conductivity of the formation just beyond the borehole.
Array 0 will be very inaccurate after borehole correction because most of its signal is borehole.
However, if Array 0 begins to approach Array 1, there is a good chance the borehole correction
parameters are correct.  In ECLIPS 2.2, Release 2, Array 0 is not available for the msec and
mbhc curves, so use Coils 1 and 2 instead.

The mitre.all.log presentation allows for comparisons in the various resolution options of the
processing.  If there are problems with the true-resolution curves, it will lead to difficulties and
aggravation in the resolution enhancement process.  In some cases, true-resolution curves may
be the only curves worth processing.  In ECLIPS 2.2, the resolution matching is likely too
aggressive and may cause excessive spiking in resistive structures (>20 ohm-m).

HDIL TRANSMITTER CONTROLLER BOARD, P/N 164807-100
NOTE
Distinguish which number board you are using, 164807-000 or 187984-000, before
proceeding with the following circuit descriptions.
An SAB80 C166 (from now on referred as SAB166) µController is the nucleus of the board.
Timers embedded in the chip generate the PAT_i signals required by the transmitter of the tool
to work.  The part has two serial ports.  One of these ports (SERIAL 1) is used to receive
commands from the EA electronics (P3.9) and transmit status and data (P3.8).  Serial
communication is asynchronous: 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit.  Baud rate is 9600.
PDS 301 (U2) provides the EPROM and RAM and associated glue-logic required by the
Controller to operate properly.  The SAB166 has 2 K of internal RAM memory but this memory
is used for stack purposes.
U13 and U15 are A/D converters.  These chips sample the signals generated by two RTDS
(connected to TMP1_RTD+ and TMP2_RTD+).  The RTD associated to TMP2_RTD is placed
close to the Transmitter Coil.  The other RTD is placed between the main and bucker coils of
subarray 6.  A shielded, twisted-pair wire takes the signal of this RTD through the Preamplifier
Section into the BeCu pipe to the Transmitter Controller Board.  The method used to measure
temperature is based on an Improved Holland Current Source.  Basically, the first stage of U12
provides a source of current.  This current generates a voltage which varies with temperature
when applied to the RTD.  The voltage is amplified by the second stage of U12.  U11 provides
an offset voltage in order to maximize the dynamic range of the measurement.
Part of Port 1 (P1.0 - P1.4) is used to generate signals required to switch latch relays.  Most of
these relays are placed in the Preamplifier section of tool.  They are used to route different
signals to the electronics channels on the upper side of the mandrel.  One latch relay is placed in
the transmitter controller board and it is used to select the reference signal as will be explained
later.
Latch relays require pulses to be switched from one state to another.  Pulses of approximately
50 msec are generated by the controller to switch the relays.  U9 (MC14160), Q3 and Q4
provide the required driving capability.
For analog signal measurements, a 10-bit A/D converter with 10 multiplexed input channels and
a sample and hold circuit has been integrated on chip in the SAB166.  Several auxiliary signals
which show the status of the tool are sampled by this A/D through U16.
A timer in the SAB166 (T1) generates a 500 KHz square signal (P3.1/T1 OUT).  Edges of this
clock are used to generate a 1 MHZ signal at the output of U18.  CC2 IO is used to enable or
disable the 1 MHZ signal, and is generated as a request from the upper electronics and
ultimately from the Surface System."

Distinguish which number board you are using, 164807-000 or 187984-000, before
proceeding with the following circuit descriptions.
This board upgrades the original, 164807-000 XC.  Some ""clean up"" can be determined
concerning the digital section of this board.  However, all of the functions are the same.  See
section 2.0.
Features which are unique to this board include a new serial EEPROM which has been added.
This EEPROM contains 1 K bytes of data used to characterize parameters of the mandrel (e.g.
serial number, temperature coeff., etc.).  A WTS command (0x15xx) supports the reading of
this EEPROM.  Eclips or WinMitre cannot write to this memory (the writing process cannot be
performed thru WTS, to avoid ""accidents"").  The EEPROM must be programmed during the
mandrel manufacturing process, and is mounted in a DIP socket.  If the Transmitter Controller
Board is replaced, the EEPROM must be unplugged and placed on the new board.  The
EEPROM always remains with its mandrel.
The temperature measurement circuitry has been changed in order to achieve better precision.
Description of one of the circuits follows, the other is identical.  U13/Q6 are a source of
current.  Approximately 2mA are forced thru the Temperature Sensor.  Voltage at the drain of
Q6 will be (5 Volts - 2mA.Rt).  U13 behaves as a amplifier and an offset generator to optimize
the dynamic range of the A/D converter.  At room temperature (25 EC), the signal at the input of
the A/D converter is slightly negative (-1.4 Volts).  At 200 EC, the signal will be approximately
8.1 Volts.  Observe that R15/R16 provide offset reference to both circuits.  And U10 provides a
single reference for the two sensors.  OP07's have been used due to their almost 0 offset voltage
specification.  These OP-Amps buffer the reference from the rest of the circuit without sacrifice
of precision.  R6/R7 and R13/R14 are 0.1 % tolerance resistors to minimize errors in the
gain/offset process."

PREAMPLIFIER BOARD WITH BALANCED OUTPUT, P/N 164630-100
Three (3) sources of signals can be applied to the input of each channel of the preamplifier
board.  These sources are:
1)
Subarray Receiver coils;
2)
A “CAL” Signal (a Reference Signal, generated by the Transmitter Section of the tool,
is attenuated and injected at the input of the Preamplifier);
3)
A Zero signal.  In this mode the amplifiers' inputs are connected to the Be-Cu pipe (the
common of the tool).
Latching relays route these different sources to the preamplifiers' input stage.
Required processing gain varies according to the particular subarray.  Subarrays placed far from
the transmitter require more gain than those placed nearby.  The first stage of the preamplifier
board is a very low-noise, broad-band amplifier.  The gain of this stage is different for each
channel.
The second stage is a 4-pole Bessel low-pass filter with a gain of one (1) in the pass band region.
Frequency cutoff is around 200 KHZ.  Bessel’s filters have very little ringing (linear phase
shift) to the step response.
The last stage is a differential-output buffer amplifier that converts a single-ended input signal to
a balanced output signal pair with high output drive.  The SSM-2141 is capable of driving
difficult loads, yielding low-distortion performance despite long cables."

This board takes care of minor chores required by the electronics to perform correctly.  These
chores are described next.
As mentioned before, all communication links between the Transmitter Controller and the
Upper Electronics are digital and meet all of the requirements of EIA Standard RS-422.
The BURST1/BURST2 signal is converted to an unbalanced unipolar signal by U6.  This signal,
now called SMPCLK has three functions:
1)
It passes through a buffer (U8).  The output of the buffer is called SMPCLK1, and this
signal strobes all the A/D converters in the Acquisition Boards.
2)
It is used to strobe constantly a retrigerable one-shot.  This one shot times out if
SMPCLK is missing for more than 4 µseconds, generating a high -to-low transition in
START1.  This signal, after passing through a driver stage and being renamed START,
re-initializes all of the Acquisition Modules.  START and SMPCLK are covered in
detail in the Acquisition Board description.
3)
It passes through another buffer (U3) and, as SMPCLK2, it is applied to a counter
embedded in the C30 DSP chip in the C30-Based Digital Controller.
When the C30-Based Digital Controller, P/N 164816-000, has to communicate with the
Transmitter Controller Board, it does so serially, generating a signal ASYCTX.  This is an
unbalanced (unipolar) signal.  The INTERFACE BOARD receives this unbalanced signal and
retransmits it balanced as TX1/TX2 meeting Standard RS-422.
RX1/RX2 is an asynchronous serial signal coming from the Transmitter Controller Board.  It is
converted to an unbalanced, unipolar signal named ASYCRX by U5 (DS2631).  This signal is
applied to the input of a UART located inside U1.  The UART detects the signal and retransmits
it to the C30-Based Digital Controller using OUT_SCLK, OUT_SDAT and OUT_EOC.  The
protocol used is described in detail in the description of the C30-Based Digital Controller, but is

ACQUISITION BOARD, P/N 164815-100
Each Acquisition Board includes four (4) modules.  Each module is virtually identical to the rest
so only one of them will be described.
From the Analog perspective, a signal coming from the preamplifier is received by an SSM-
2141.  This is an integrated differential amplifier intended to receive balanced line inputs, with
very low distortion.  The output of the differential line receiver is applied to a non-inverting
stage that has a gain of five (5).  Finally, the signal goes through a level-shifting process and
into the A/D converter.
A description of the manner in which the level-shift takes place follows:
The A/D converter requires unipolar signals with amplitude between 0 and Vref.  In this
application, Vref is 4.096.  Vref is divided by two, with two 5-Kohm resistors.  This voltage is
added to the signal at the input of the buffer driving the input of the A/D.  It can be seen that
when no signal comes from the Preamplifier, the input of the A/D converter will be a DC level
of Vref/2.
From the digital perspective, a one MegaSample per second A/D Converter and an Analog
Devices 2101 DSP component take care of the Stacking Process.  Two kinds of events take
place in the Acquisition Module: Data Acquisition and Signature Transfer.
Data Acquisition
Two (2) signals control the Acquisition Process.  One of them is START.  A High-to-Low
transition of START initializes all of the functions of the DSP 2101.  Notice that Start is
actually an interrupt signal for the 2101.
The other control signal is SMPCLK.  This is a normally high signal.  Each transition from high
to low of this signal starts a digitizing process in the A/D.
For the next discussion take a look at Figure 945-05.  SMPCLK is applied to the S/H pin of the
A/D and that is the way it has been labeled on the figure.  A few nanoseconds after the start of
the conversion, EOC goes low generating an interrupt to the DSP processor.  The 2101, during
the conversion time, reads the data corresponding to the previous conversion.  You can see
when the 2101 is reading the A/D data bus because a PMS signal is generated by the DSP chip.
By the time EOC goes high, the DSP chip has already finished the reading process.  This
process continues as long as the SMPCLK’s keep strobing.  The DSP chip will build up a
signature according to the process described in the General Description of the tool.

CPU FUNCTIONALITY
Reference drawing 164816-100
The CPU board has two distinct bus systems.  The primary address bus (A0 - A23) and data bus
(D0 - D31) provide a zero wait state high speed bus for program and data storage.  The
secondary address bus (XA0 - XA12) and data bus (XD0 - XD31) provide an auxiliary bus for
slower transactions.  The two busses are totally independent of one another, with their own
control signals.
7.3.1
Power-on Reset
Upon power up, a reset supervisor chip (U15) provides a 200 mS reset hold off, holding the
TMS reset pin (F1) low while the power supplies stabilize.  The interrupt vectors are in low
memory, and the reset vector is fetched from location 0x000000 on the primary bus. See Figure

1515-HDIL-AMO,Level 3 Preventive Maintenance - 1.0 OVERVIEW,"OVERVIEW
When addressing Maintenance problems on the 1515 HDIL Tool, some important issues must be
understood.
The tool does not require any electrical adjustment.  Other than the ""nulling"" of the subarrays (a
mechanical procedure that takes place during manufacturing) this tool has NO adjustments.
Critical communications between assembly modules uses twisted pairs of wire for BALANCED
transmission.  This applies to ALL the Analog Signals through the tool and most of the Digital
Signals.  An unbalanced scope probe is not recommended to view the balanced signals coming
into or out of each board.  In the case of analog signals related to the measurement, these
twisted pairs are shielded if the signal level is very low or the length of the link justifies it.
Measurement of signals on Surface Mount (SMT) Boards is not recommended if the tool is
operating properly.  This statement means that the software tools provided should be adequate
enough to monitor the performance of the instrument.  In fact, the 1515 EA Acquisition System
is the best measurement tool that you'll ever find to diagnose any problem that occurs.  Because
of the level of modularity (8 independent identical channels to measure each of the 8 signals of
interest), it is relatively easy to track an offending signal.
It is not recommended to replace surface mount components in the Field.  SMT boards should
be debugged to the ""board level"" and only if a very minor problem is detected, should a fix be
attempted.
The Backbone of the Pre-Amp section (the triangular chassis) can be used as a common for
unbalanced signals measurements.  The Backbone of the EA can be used as a common for
unbalanced digital signal measurements (even though it is not recommended!).  The Backbone
of the Transmitter Section Electronics (bottom of the tool) CANNOT BE USED as a common
for any signal measurements.  The entire lower section of the tool is ""DC floating"" for reasons
related to the measurement of the SP.
When using backbones to attach oscilloscope ground leads, make sure that good contact is
achieved.  Remember that aluminum is a good conductor but anodization, in most of the cases,

1515 MA AC Current Requirment
For this part of the check-out, the mandrel must be powered up.  Since the mandrel is
disassembled you can power it up several different ways.
a.
The recommended way is to connect the 1515 EA to the 1515 MA (you can use
umbilical cord P/N 153974-000) and apply 180 VAC to the top of the 1515 EA.
Be very careful when making the connection between the 1515 EA and 1515 MA.
At this point there are no keys and if the two field joint connectors are not
properly aligned, you can damage these connectors.
b.
Apply 180 VAC to pins 1 & 4 at the top of the 1515 MA.
WARNING
ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN APPLYING ANY LEVEL
VOLTAGE TO THE TOOL.
c.
Use Evaluation Panel.
d.
Apply 180 VAC from the bottom of the tool.  In this case you do not need to
hook up the upper electronics, but you need to reinstall the pressure bulkhead

OVERVIEW
The HDIL tool controller for windows (referred to as Winmitre) is a PC-based system for
operating the WALS high definition induction tool.  The tool, which uses an array of seven
receivers to sense the conductivity of downhole formations, is controlled and guided by
Winmitre, for testing purposes and for temperature characterization of newly manufactured
instruments.
The Winmitre program's purpose is to act as a user interface to the tool, allowing high-level
user control by automating low-level tool commands.  The program gathers, interprets, and
displays (in text and graphics) data which the tool sends uphole.  It uses Fourier transformation
techniques to process the voltage information it receives into the frequency domain for better
analysis.  It stores the data on disk and can play back this stored information.  The program is
also responsible for keeping track of the calibration information which the tool is capable of
producing and uses that information to process tool data.
This program is used in the laboratory environment to test and debug the tool.  It is also used to
perform a temperature characterization during final assembly and test of a tool.  Direct control
of most tool  functions is allowed at a low level, although at the same time the program has the
ability to run in an automated and user-friendly manner."

THE TCC WINDOW
The Tool Command and Control (TCC) window is used to issue commands to the tool.  It can
be fetched at any time from the Windows menu, and can be dismissed at any time by clicking the
Dismiss Window button or using the close menu item in it's resizable frame.  It can be
minimized by the minimize button in the upper right corner.  If dismissed or minimized, it can
be restored by selecting TCC Window under the Windows menu of the text viewer in the
background.
The TCC window controls several tool commands and keeps itself up to date on the current state
of the tool by periodically polling the tool's status.  It also indicates whether or not the current
data is being saved to a file by displaying NOT SAVING or SAVING IN <file> in an edit box at
the bottom of the window.
2.1.1
Transmitter on/off
These radio buttons allow the user to select the state of the transmitter.  When clicked, the
buttons send the tool a command to switch the transmitter on or off and check to see if it has
happened.  If not, an error is reported and the buttons go to an indeterminate state in which no
button is pressed to indicate that the computer does not know which state the tool is in.
2.1.2
Tool Mode Selection
These buttons allow the user to select whether the tool is in ZERO, CAL or LOG mode.  The
mode determines what data will be collected during an acquisition.  ZERO mode is an all-
inputs-grounded amplified signal used to measure noise from the electronics for calibration
purposes.  CAL is the mode in which a known signal is sent through each channel to facilitate
measuring the gain of the electronics for calibration.  LOG is the standard mode wherein the
receiver coils monitor the response of the formation or surroundings to the signal transmitted by
the tool.  These buttons have a self-checking feature like the transmitter controls, reporting
error if the command failed.
2.1.3* Monitor Selection
There can be two methods of monitoring the transmitters output: a monitor of the voltage
applied to the transmitter coil (Driver) and a monitor of the magnetic field produced by the
transmitter (Sense Coil).  The tool uses a magnetic field monitor, therefore the Sense Coil is the
default and should always be the one selected."

The tool status viewer window displays several pieces of information.  In the upper left corner it
shows the source of the sample (this will either say TOOL if the sample came from a tool, or a
filename and subset number if the sample came from a file while in the PLAYBACK mode).  To
the right of that it shows the time the sample was taken.  Below these displays it shows a set of
information which comes from the header of each acquisition (Subset 0 or Subset 1) which is
sent uphole.  This information includes the status of the tool at acquire time, some temperature
readings from the tool, and some voltage readings.
The box displaying a specific piece of information lights up red if the reading is out of its
allowed range, which is displayed at the bottom of each box.
The information in the status boxes comes from the header of each acquisition.  This header is
32 words long.  The button labeled Extra Info shows the first 20 of these additional words from
the header in their hexadecimal form for debugging purposes.
This window can be dismissed, minimized, and restored in the same manner as the TCC

The toolbar is the bar of buttons under the menu bar in the main view window.  The buttons on
it are mapped to certain menu items to provide easier access to those commands which are most
useful.  It also contains an important display box which tells the user whether or not the data is

ACQUIRING DATA
To get data from the tool simply select the subset you wish to get under the Acquire menu.  It
will be sent to the surface on the communication channel determined by the mapping selected in
the TCC window (subset 0 and 1 are actually only supported on Mode 5), and displayed in the
main view.  Once there is valid information in the computer's memory, the menu items (and
corresponding buttons) for graphing and view selection become enabled.  The user can now
choose a view other than the default (Frequency Data), and the screen will update to show it.
By choosing Graph... Voltages, or its button counterpart, the user can bring up a display of the
voltage signatures as they might look on an oscilloscope.
2.4.1* Data Settings
The menu item Data Settings, under the Settings menu, controls some of the factors that affect
the way acquisition takes place.  Selecting Data Settings brings up a dialogue box to allow input
of several things.
!
Number of samples per set: This sets the number of samples which should be defaulted
to 96.
!
Number of harmonics in FFT: This sets the number of harmonics to calculate in the
Fourier transform when processing the data.  This should not be changed unless the user
is prepared to change all of the calibration data as well (the calibration information is
fixed at 16 harmonics).
!
Nominal DC offsets for A/Ds:  There are eight (8) boxes for input of nominal DC offset
for each receiver.  These are used to convert the values sent uphole by the A/D boards
on the tool into voltage readings.  There is an Update button under these eight (8)
boxes.  When the button is pressed, the program calculates all of the DC offsets based
on the last acquisition and updates the data in the boxes.  The next acquisition will use
these updated DC offsets.  These offsets are stored and updated in the file calcoeff.sav.
Updating the DC offsets is useful when looking at the waveforms in the voltage graphs,
particularly when looking at the Zero-mode waveforms using a zoom of 1,000 or so.  If
you do NOT update, the program used the old offsets which are in calcoeff.sav, and
these may even be from a different tool which might have significantly different DC
offsets.

default which is: <....>.dat"

USING THE GRAPHS
When a subset is loaded into memory from the tool (or from a file), a good way to see its
contents is not in the view window but in a graph window.  By choosing Graph... Voltages or
Graph... Frequencies the user can view a display of the data in a compact visual form.
2.5.1
The Voltage Graph and its Controls
Considerable functionality is available through this window.  It pops up and can be
moved/dismissed/restored in the same way as the TCC window and other windows.  It contains
a display of the time the sample was taken if the sample came from the tool, or of the filename
and number of the sample if the program is in PLAYBACK mode.  It also displays any text
associated with the sample (added when entering SAVE mode, or read when loading a file).
The window has several controls.  Each graph displays a plot of voltage versus time for one
receiver.  By clicking on any of these graphs, a new window pops up displaying graphs con-
taining more information on the particular receiver.  This new window is described in the
section on the close-up window.  The button labeled Zoom redefines the magnification factor of
the Y axis in the graphs of receivers 0 through 6.  (The Reference display signal is not zoomed
with the others because it is usually a different order of magnitude from the rest of the
receivers.)  If the Zoom button is clicked, it brings up a dialogue box for setting a new
magnification of the Y axis.  The first field in the dialogue is for a DC offset.  The number here
is the voltage (in millivolts) the graphs are centered about.  The second field is the
magnification factor to apply.  In a non-conductive environment a magnification of around 50 to
100 is appropriate for looking at the signals in LOG mode.  A zoom of 1,000 is useful for
examining the Zero signal for noise or cross-talk, etc.
There are Acquire Subset and Next Playback buttons as well.  By pushing Acquire Subset you
tell the tool to get a new sample for viewing.  This screen will automatically update itself to
show the new data.  By pushing Next Playback, you ask to see the next sample in the currently
open file.  If the program is not in PLAYBACK mode (see below), pushing the button will cause
an error message."

FILE INPUT AND OUTPUT
The Winmitre program supports a logging-style saving of data to files on disk, as well as
playback from files.  Each data file also contains up to 100 characters of user-defined text
describing the data set.  Files consist of all data samples acquired while the program was in
SAVE mode.  Each sample includes the raw data acquired from the tool, the header information
which is shown in the Tool Status Viewer window, and the complete calibration state of the
program at the time the sample was taken.
The entire calibration state is saved to ensure that everything can look exactly the same when it
is played back as when it was saved.
The toolbar has a display that can show any of the following: Saving, Not Saving, or Playback.
This section will describe how to make use of the SAVE mode to store data to disk files and the
PLAYBACK mode to read it back later.
Files are stored in binary format, unreadable except by the Winmitre program itself.  However,
since it is sometimes necessary to export data into other programs (Mathcad, for example), the
ability to generate an ASCII text output of any sample is provided in the File menu.
2.6.1
The SAVE Mode
SAVE mode may be turned on at any time by selecting the Saving item under the file menu, or
alternately by clicking the button that looks like a diskette on the toolbar.  Doing this toggles
the SAVE mode ON and OFF.  If the menu item for saving has a check mark next to it, the
toolbar should indicate Saving (unless the PLAYBACK mode is also in operation) and the SAVE
mode will be on.  Selecting Saving now turns it off.  If there is no check by Saving, the toolbar
should indicate Not Saving and SAVE mode is off.  Selecting it now will turn it ON.
When the SAVE mode is ON every time a Subset 0 or Subset 1 is acquired from the tool, it is
automatically saved at the end of the currently saving file along with the calibration
information.  Other actions, such as loading a data set from another file, have no effect on the
file.  However, since zeroing or otherwise calibrating the tool requires acquiring a Subset 0 or
Subset 1, that data will be appended to the file.  Thanks to the header information displayed in
the Tool Status Viewer, the user will be notified during playback what mode the data was
acquired in, so there will be no confusion between the CAL and LOG modes.
Immediately upon activating the SAVE mode, the user is prompted for a text description of the
data that is to be acquired.  This blurb of text will be placed in the first 100 bytes of the file.
From then on the file grows with every acquisition until the user turns the SAVE mode OFF.
The user is then prompted for a filename of the form mitreXX.dat, where XX is a number
between 1 and 99.  The computer prompts the user with the next logical filename.  If cancel is
pressed in this file dialogue box, the SAVE mode is left off and the file is not created."

CALIBRATION
Using the HDIL tool requires a lot of computer-managed calibration.  The Winmitre program
attempts to perform as much of this as is possible.  In normal circumstances, calibration using
internal ZERO and CAL is sufficient.  The AIR and LOOP calibration is not necessary if the
default calibration is adequate.
There are several arrays of complex numbers the program uses to obtain values for apparent
conductivity from the raw data.  In the program these are named VREZ, GER, KFAC, MM,
and AM.  VREZ and GER are used to compensate for electronic noise and electronic gain and
phase shift.  KFAC converts from receiver voltage to apparent conductivity based on the tool
design configuration.  MM and AM are used to compensate for the gain and phase shifts
introduced by the mandrel.
GER and VREZ are obtained by selecting Zero and Cal under the Cal menu.  KFAC is
calculated from the tool design parameters.  MM and AM are acquired from primary
calibration."

1590EA-AMO,Circuit Description - 2.0 HDIL TRANSMITTER CONTROLLER BOARD........................................ 5,"HDIL TRANSMITTER CONTROLLER BOARD
Refer to assembly drawing A3001485000 and schematic drawing A3001485 SCH.
An SAB80 C166 (from now on referred as SAB166) μController (U1) is the nucleus of the board.
Timers embedded in the chip generate the PAT_i signals required by the transmitter of the tool to
work. The part has two serial ports. One of these ports (SERIAL 1) is used to receive commands
from the EA electronics (P3.9) and transmit status and data (P3.8). Serial communication is
asynchronous: 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit. Baud rate is 9600.
PDS 301 (U2) provides the EPROM and RAM and associated glue-logic required by the
Controller to operate properly. The SAB166 has 2 K of internal RAM memory but this memory is
used for stack purposes.
U13 and U15 are A/D converters. These chips sample the signals generated by two RTDS
(connected to TMP1_RTD+ and TMP2_RTD+). The RTD associated to TMP2_RTD is placed
close to the Transmitter Coil. The other RTD is placed between the main and bucker coils of
subarray 6. A shielded, twisted-pair wire takes the signal of this RTD through the Preamplifier
Section into the Beryllium copper (BeCu) pipe to the Transmitter Controller Board. The method
used to measure temperature is based on an Improved Holland Current Source. Basically, the first
stage of U12 provides a source of current. This current generates a voltage that varies with
temperature when applied to the RTD. The voltage is amplified by the second stage of U12. U11
provides an offset voltage to maximize the dynamic range of the measurement.
Part of Port 1 (P1.0 - P1.4) generates signals required to switch latch relays. Most of these relays
are placed in the Preamplifier section of tool. They route different signals to the electronics
channels on the upper side of the mandrel. One latch relay is placed in the transmitter controller
board and it selects the reference signal as will be explained later.
Latch relays require pulses to be switched from one state to another. Pulses of approximately 50
msec are generated by the controller to switch the relays. U9 (MC14160), Q3 and Q4 provide the
required driving capability.
For analog signal measurements, a 10-bit A/D converter with 10 multiplexed input channels and a
sample and hold circuit has been integrated in the SAB166 chip. Several auxiliary signals that
show the status of the tool are sampled by this A/D through U16.
A timer in the SAB166 (T1) generates a 500 kHz square signal (P3.1/T1 OUT). Edges of this
clock generate a 1.0 MHz signal at the output of U18. CC2 IO enables or disables the 1.0 MHz
signal, and is generated as a request from the upper electronics and ultimately from the Surface

Circuit Description
1590 MA HTHP WTS HDIL Induction Mandrel
131024-945
JULY 2010

The 1.0 MHz signal (U20-pin 3) and CC2 IO are applied to the inputs of a NAND gate (U19). The
output of this gate is called BURST. The BURST signal is ultimately used to strobe the A/D's of
the Acquisition Modules in the Upper Electronics. All of the communication links between the
transmitter Controller and the Upper Electronics are digital and meet all the requirements of EIA
Standard RS-422. U7 and U8 are designed to provide unipolar differential drive to twisted pair
transmission lines. DS2631 (U8) is a High-Speed Differential Line Driver designed for digital
data transmission over-balanced lines. The DS2632 (U7) is a quad-differential line receiver that
offers optimum performance when used with the DS2631.
Features that are unique to this board include a new serial EEPROM which has been added. This
EEPROM contains 1 K bytes of data used to characterize parameters of the mandrel (e.g. serial
number, temperature coeff., etc.). A WTS command (0x15xx) supports the reading of this
EEPROM. Eclips or WinMitre cannot write to this memory (the writing process cannot be
performed through WTS, to avoid ""accidents""). The EEPROM must be programmed during the
mandrel manufacturing process, and is mounted in a DIP socket. If the Transmitter Controller
Board is replaced, the EEPROM must be unplugged and placed on the new board. The EEPROM
always remains with its mandrel.
The temperature measurement circuitry has been changed to achieve better precision. Description
of one of the circuits follows, the other is identical. U13/Q6 are a source of current.
Approximately 2.0 mA are forced through the Temperature Sensor. Voltage at the drain of Q6 will
be (5 Volts – 2 mA Rt). U13 behaves as a amplifier and an offset generator to optimize the
dynamic range of the A/D converter. At room temperature (25° C), the signal at the input of the
A/D converter is slightly negative (-1.4 Volts). At 200° C, the signal will be approximately 8.1
Volts. Observe that R15/R16 provide offset reference to both circuits. U10 provides a single
reference for the two sensors. OP07's have been used because of their almost 0 (zero) offset
voltage specification. These OP-Amps buffer the reference from the rest of the circuit without
sacrificing precision. R6/R7 and R13/R14 are 0.1 % tolerance resistors to minimize errors in the
gain/offset process.
Typical Acquisition Sequence
When a Stop/Start Command is received by the SAB166 (U1), CC2 IO goes low (if it is NOT
already low) and after a short period of time (used for synchronization purposes) it activates (goes
high), initiating an acquisition period. By default, CC2 IO will remain active for around 400 ms,
but if another Stop/Start Command is received, CC2 IO will be forced low, and after an additional
short period of time, required for synchronization, will activate again, repeating the cycle.
Each time CC2 IO activates (CC2 IO is active high), an acquisition cycle takes place. As
mentioned, the length of CC2 IO by default is approximately 400 ms, but it can be varied by
software (in that way, the length of the BURST is changed). An interesting case occurs when the
length of CC2 IO is set to 96 μsec. In this case the BURST signal will be 96 pulses (μsec) long.
The reception of just one transmitter period will be digitized. This will be ""unstacked"", ""raw""
data, and it gives a feeling of the kind of signals present at the input of the A/D (normally quite

1590EA-AMO,Circuit Description - 3.0 PREAMPLIFIER BOARDS........................................................................ 7,"PREAMPLIFIER BOARDS
Three preamplifier boards are used in the 1590 MA instrument they are:
•
F188001000 – Channels 0, 1, 2
•
F188006000 – Channels 3 and 4
•
F188007000 – channels 5 and 6.
These three board are all functionally identical and only a general description is provided.
Three (3) sources of signals can be applied to the input of each channel of the CH0, 1, 2
preamplifier board, while two sources can be applied to the CH3, 4, and 5. These sources are:
•
Subarray Receiver coils,
•
“CAL” Signal (a Reference Signal, generated by the Transmitter Section of the tool, is
attenuated and injected at the input of the Preamplifier), and
•
Zero signal. In this mode the amplifiers' inputs are connected to the Be-Cu pipe, which is the
common of the tool.
Latching relays route these different sources to the preamplifiers' input stage.
Required processing gain varies according to the particular subarray. Subarrays placed far from
the transmitter require more gain than those placed nearby. The first stage of the preamplifier
board is a very low-noise, broad-band amplifier. The gain of this stage is different for each
channel.
The second stage is a four-pole Bessel low-pass filter with a gain of one (1) in the pass band
region. Frequency cutoff is around 200 kHz. Bessel’s filters have very little ringing (linear phase
shift) to the step response.
The last stage is a differential-output buffer amplifier that converts a single-ended input signal to
a balanced output signal pair with high output drive. The SSM-2142 is capable of driving difficult
loads, yielding low-distortion performance despite long cables.

1530 TRANSMITTER DRIVER
Refer to assembly drawing F187985000 and schematic drawing F187985100.
The Transmitter Driver receives control signals from the Controller Board and drives the
transmitter coil.
PAT1 and PAT2 are signals intended to drive the gate of FET's Q1 and Q2. T1 and T2 are
transformers intended to ""float"" the driving of the gates. Q3/Q4 and Q5/Q6 are transistor pairs
that drive the transformers.
For the next discussion, we assume the voltage on the drain of Q1 is 55 volts and the voltage on
the source of Q2 is -55 volts. In other words, we are neglecting the voltage drop on R9 and R10.
These 0.2 ohm resistors are there to avoid current spikes, and voltage drop through them is
negligible.
If Q1 is on, (55 - VdsQ1) volts are applied to the transmitter coil. (VdsQ1 is the voltage drop
through Q1.) When Q1 is turned off, a large amount of current is circulating through the coil.
This current will have to continue to circulate, and it will do so through D4 (there is no physical
way to switch the current circulating through an inductor from a large value to zero
instantaneously). Voltage on the coil will change fast from +(55 - VdsQ1) to -(55 + VdD4), Vd
being the voltage drop on the diode (voltage on a coil can change fast). Current through the coil
will start to decrease slowly. If Q2 is turned on, there will be a moment when current will no
longer circulate through D4, and it will start circulating through Q2. By then, -(55 - VdsQ2) Volts
will be applied to the coil.
When Q2 is turned off, a large amount of negative current will be circulating through the coil,
and D2 will now be turned on to comply with the principles of Kirchhoff's Law. Voltage through
the coil will change from -(55 - VdsQ2) Volts to (55 + VdD2). If Q1 is turned on, there will be a
moment when current will no longer circulate through D2, and it will start circulating through
Q1, (55 - VdsQ1) volts will be applied to the coil and we are back to the beginning.
The square waveform rise time or fill time can be controlled with C3 and C4. These two
capacitors have been chosen to have 1.8 μsec transition time, when transition time is the time
required by the square waveform to go from 10% to 90% of its value.
U1 and U2 are programmable regulators. By choosing the correct value of resistors and Zener
diodes, a wide range of output voltages can be achieved. For this application, the regulators
provide the plus and minus (+/-) 55 volts required for the transmitter to operate properly.

Refer to assembly drawing A3001439000 and schematic drawing A3001439 SCH.
This board takes care of minor chores required by the electronics to perform correctly. These
chores are described next.
As mentioned before, all communication links between the Transmitter Controller and the Upper
Electronics are digital and meet all of the requirements of EIA Standard RS-422.
The BURST1/BURST2 signal is converted to an unbalanced unipolar signal by U6. This signal,
now called SMPCLK has three functions:
1. It passes through a buffer (U8). The output of the buffer is called SMPCLK1 and this signal
strobes all the A/D converters in the Acquisition Boards.
2. It strobes a retrigerable one-shot constantly. This one shot times out if SMPCLK is missing
for more than 4.0 µsec, generating a high -to-low transition in START1. This signal, after
passing through a driver stage and being renamed START, re-initializes all of the Acquisition
Modules. START and SMPCLK are covered in detail in the Acquisition Board description.
3. It passes through another buffer (U3) and, as SMPCLK2, it is applied to a counter embedded
in the C30 DSP chip in the C30-Based Digital Controller.
When the C30-Based Digital Controller PCBA, P/N A3001304000, communicates with the
Transmitter Controller Board, it does so serially, generating a signal ASYCTX. This is an
unbalanced (unipolar) signal. The Interface Board receives this unbalanced signal at U5 pin 15
and retransmits it balanced as TX1/TX2 meeting Standard RS-422.
RX1/RX2 is an asynchronous serial signal coming from the Transmitter Controller Board. It is
converted to an unbalanced, unipolar signal named ASYCRX by U6. This signal is applied to the
input of a UART located inside U1. The UART detects the signal and retransmits it to the C30-
Based Digital Controller using OUT_SCLK, OUT_SDAT and OUT_EOC. The protocol used is
described in detail in the description of the C30-Based Digital Controller, but is basically a serial-

Refer to assembly drawing F185337000 and schematic drawing F185337100.
Each Acquisition Board includes four modules. Each module is virtually identical to the rest so
only one of them will be described.
From the analog perspective, a signal coming from the preamplifier is received by an SSM-2142.
This is an integrated differential amplifier that receives balanced line inputs, with very low
distortion. The output of the differential line receiver is applied to a non-inverting stage that has a
gain of five. Finally, the signal goes through a level-shifting process and into the A/D converter.
A description of the manner in which the level-shift takes place follows:
The A/D converter requires unipolar signals with amplitude between 0 and Vref. In this
application, Vref is 4.096. Vref is divided by two, with two 5k-ohm resistors. This voltage is
added to the signal at the input of the buffer driving the input of the A/D. It can be seen that when
no signal comes from the Preamplifier, the input of the A/D converter will be a DC level of
Vref/2.
From the digital perspective, a one Mega Sample per second A/D Converter and an Analog
Devices 2101 DSP component take care of the Stacking Process. Two kinds of events take place
in the Acquisition Module: Data Acquisition and Signature Transfer.

Data Acquisition
Two signals control the Acquisition Process. One of them is START. A High-to-Low transition of
START initializes all of the functions of the DSP 2101. Notice that START is actually an interrupt
signal for the 2101.
The other control signal is SMPCLK. This is a normally high signal. Each transition from high to
low of this signal starts a digitizing process in the A/D.
For the next discussion take a look at Figure 4. SMPCLK is applied to the S/H pin of the A/D
and that is the way it has been labeled on the figure. A few nanoseconds after the start of the
conversion, EOC goes low generating an interrupt to the DSP processor. The 2101, during the
conversion time, reads the data corresponding to the previous conversion. You can see when the
2101 is reading the A/D data bus because a PMS signal is generated by the DSP chip. By the time
EOC goes high, the DSP chip has already finished the reading process. This process continues as
long as the SMPCLK’s keep strobing. The DSP chip will build up a signature according to the

Signature Transfer
The DSP is always working with two buffers. One buffer is the one that builds the signature. The
other buffer is ready to be transmitted to the C30-Based Digital Controller.
The 2101 provides a complete synchronous serial interface. Serial port 0 has a 5-pin interface,
consisting of the following signals: SCLK, RFS, TFS, DR and DT. Only three of these signals are
used by the Acquisition Module: TFS, SCLK, and DT. In this application, the clock is driven by
the C30-Based Digital Controller. The serial transfer starts when a TFS (TFS0) is received by the
DSP chip. The serial port has a feature known as auto-buffering with Single-Cycled Overhead.
This means the serial port can automatically receive or transmit the contents of an entire data
buffer with only one overhead cycle per data word. This feature transfers the signature data from
the internal DSP memory to the C30-Based Digital Controller. The whole buffer is transferred,
transparent to the program that is running into the DSP Chip component. Once the buffer has
been sent, an internal interrupt occurs that terminates the transfer sequence between this module
and the C30-Based Digital Controller. Transistor 2 N7002 provides driving capability. The drain
on all the modules is connected to a 1 K pull-up resistor in the Interface Board.

mux with the proper address will propagate the TFS signal to the correct DSP chip. Notice four
jumpers are present on each board. These jumpers distinguish between channels 0, 1, 2, 3 and
channels 5, 6, 7, R. Channel 0 processes subarray 0, channel 1 processes subarray 1, etc. The
reference is processed by channel R.
The 2101 has an internal data memory and an internal program memory, and executes the
stacking program from internal RAM. Booting circuitry provides for loading on-chip program
memory automatically from byte-wide external memory. After reset, an EEPROM is used as an
external boot memory. Once the EEPROM has been read, it is no longer needed and it goes to a
low-power mode. This happens when BMS/ on the DSP chip goes high. BMS/ is the signal on the
DSP chip that controls the booting process.

The 1590 EA/MA/FA High Definition Induction Log, HDIL is similar in function and design to
the 1515 EA/MA WTS HDIL, but is rated for higher temperatures (up to 500º F) and pressures
(up to 30, 000 psi). The electronics and sensors are packaged with flasked pressure housings
along with additional active and passive temperature sensors. To allow the mandrel electronics to
be installed inside a flasked pressure housing, the 1515 MA was separated into two sections
(1590 MA and 1590 FA). The 1590 MA mandrel section contains the measurement coil array. The
1590 FA contains the mandrel electronics chassis. The 1590 EA electronics chassis remains
unchanged from the 1515 EA, but installed into a new Flasked housing.
The 1590 is designed to operate in a 500º F  environment for up to 6 hours, in some cases even
longer. To get the maximum longevity at this temperature the operator needs to know what the
internal tool temperature is and how fast it is rising. The tool string is outfitted with 10
temperature sensors (4 from the EA section, 4 from the MA, and 2 from the FA). These readings
are transmitted to the surface and displayed on a comprehensive plot showing present
temperature, temperature rise, and remaining time to reach critical maximum temperature.
The 1590 High Definition Induction Log transmits a complex magnetic waveform into the
formation. Different arrays of coils detect this complex waveform. The received signals are
processed by the tool and then sent to a surface computer.
The heart of the tool is the transmitter section (1590 FA). This section generates all the timing
signals required by the tool to work properly. Setup parameters concerning the operation of the
instrument can be changed through commands to this section. The communication between the
transmitter section and the rest of the tool takes place serially through balanced twisted pair lines.
The major functions of the transmitter controller are:
•
Generate the logic to drive the transmitter,
•
generate the synchronization logic that will be sent to the acquisition system,
•
generate the logic that switches the tool to the different operating modes (ZERO, CAL,
LOG),
•
measure temperatures at two points on the mandrel, main electronics, and transmitter
electronics sections, and
•
select the kind of reference signal. The reference is a signal that characterizes the complex
waveform transmitted into the formation. Several points in the electronics monitor this signal.
A command can be sent to the transmitter controller to switch between two monitor points.
This command is useful mainly for testing purposes.
•
Save calibration data related to the mandrel. This feature gives you the ability to swap

As mentioned before, the signal coming from the formation are detected by sets of coils. Each set
of coils, plus the transmitter, is a measuring unit known as subarray. The transmitter is common to
all subarrays. The tool has seven subarrays, with subarray 0 (zero) having its detector coils closest
to the transmitter.
Each set of receiver coils has two components: the bucker coil (closest to the transmitter) and the
main coil. Figure 1 below shows the way each subarray works:


interaction is the one measured. There is also a direct ""transformer effect"" between the transmitter
and receiver that is useless for logging purpose. The bucker coil is there to cancel this direct
interaction.
Each subarray has a preamplifier channel associated with it as seen in Figure 2. The components
of the preamplifier channel are:
•
a balanced input amplifier,
•
a broad band band-pass filter, and
•
a balance output driver.

Circuit Description
1590 MA HTHP WTS HDIL Induction Mandrel

The preamplifier section of the tool, placed in the upper area of the mandrel (1590 MA), contains
all of the preamplifier channels. A triangular chassis holds three (3) preamplifier boards with each
board capable of holding up to three (3) preamplifier channels. Only one board processes three
(3) channels, while the other two boards process two (2) channels each.
Once the signals from each subarray have been amplified, they are sent to the main electronics
(1590 EA section of the tool) through shielded twisted-pair wires. Seven DSP-based Acquisition
Modules sample and process the signals from each subarray. The processing is called stacking
and, as a result, seven (7) Signatures are generated. A signature is a 96-point buffer, and each
point is characterized by a 32-bit number.
Refer to Figure 3 to better understand the way the stacker works.

Circuit Description
1590 MA HTHP WTS HDIL Induction Mandrel

The transmitter creates a repetitive signal. The received signal contains the information being
sought, but is normally buried by noise. If we add up or ""stack"" 1, 2 and 3, etc., assuming the
noise is random, the true signal will ""clean up"". It is clear that the more we stack, the better the
signal looks. Limitations to the method will be imposed by the logging speed and the size of the
register used to save the summation. The process must be fast enough so we can consider that the
formation doesn't change. The period of the transmitted signal is 96 µsec. The Acquisition
Module acquires data at 1.0 Mega-samples per second. This means that one transmitter period
will be sampled 96 times. The 96-point sampled signal is ""stacked up"" for a variable period of
time. The C30-Based Digital Controller tracks this time together with the SAB166 Controller
(U1), or the Transmitter section of the tool. In this manner it is possible to figure out how many
stacking processes took place.




It is important to notice that normally the transmitter runs all the time while the stacking
process takes place only on command. The whole stacking process can be controlled
from the surface.

The transmitter can be turned off with a command from the surface, but this command is issued
only for debugging and testing purposes.
An eighth DSP-based module samples the reference and a signature of the reference is also
generated.
Two boards contain the Acquisition Modules (F185337000). Each board has four acquisition
modules. The boards are indistinguishable and a set of four (4) jumpers (per board) enables
communication with one board or the other.
A Main Electronics board (F164825000), based on floating point DSP chip (TMS320 C30)
serially collects all of the signatures. Functions of the Main Electronics board are:
•
Communication with surface (decode commands, transmit and receive data), and
•
acquisition of the signatures and eventually, further process them (compression scheme).
The Main Electronics Board cannot handle asynchronous serial reception efficiently. Neither can
it address each of the DSP acquisition channels. An Interface board (A3001439000), based on an
8xC51 controller, handles all of these tasks. This board is located in the 1590 EA Instrument and
provides:
•
Control lines required to address the Acquisition Modules,
•
serial-balanced drivers and receivers required to communicate the C30-Based Digital
Controller with the transmitter, and
•
temperature sensors to monitor the temperature inside each tool section.
A UART embedded in the controller receives asynchronous data from the transmitter electronics
and converts this data into a protocol understood by the C30-Based Digital Controller.
