Some \\\"clean up\\\" can be determined\\nconcerning the digital section of this board.  However, all of the functions are the same.  See\\nsection 2.0.\\nFeatures which are unique to this board include a new serial EEPROM which has been added.\\nThis EEPROM contains 1 K bytes of data used to characterize parameters of the mandrel (e.g.\\nserial number, temperature coeff., etc.).  A WTS command (0x15xx) supports the reading of\\nthis EEPROM.  Eclips or WinMitre cannot write to this memory (the writing process cannot be\\nperformed thru WTS, to avoid \\\"accidents\\\").  The EEPROM must be programmed during the\\nmandrel manufacturing process, and is mounted in a DIP socket.  If the Transmitter Controller\\nBoard is replaced, the EEPROM must be unplugged and placed on the new board.  The\\nEEPROM always remains with its mandrel.\\nThe temperature measurement circuitry has been changed in order to achieve better precision.\\nDescription of one of the circuits follows, the other is identical.  U13/Q6 are a source of\\ncurrent.  Approximately 2mA are forced thru the Temperature Sensor.  Voltage at the drain of\\nQ6 will be (5 Volts - 2mA.Rt).  U13 behaves as a amplifier and an offset generator to optimize\\nthe dynamic range of the A/D converter.  At room temperature (25 EC), the signal at the input of\\nthe A/D converter is slightly negative (-1.4 Volts).  At 200 EC, the signal will be approximately\\n8.1 Volts.  Observe that R15/R16 provide offset reference to both circuits.  And U10 provides a\\nsingle reference for the two sensors.  OP07's have been used due to their almost 0 offset voltage\\nspecification.  These OP-Amps buffer the reference from the rest of the circuit without sacrifice\\nof precision.  R6/R7 and R13/R14 are 0.1 % tolerance resistors to minimize errors in the\\ngain/offset process.\",\n          \"5\\n\\n1311 XA  GAMMA RAY\\nP/N 107846-945\\nMARCH 2000\"\n        ],\n

The\\n150 VDC is routed to a filter network on the power supply\\nassembly consisting of L1, C12, R6, and C11 which drops the\\nvoltage down to approximately 140 VDC.\\nThe voltage is then routed through a negative voltage protector\\ndiode (D13) to the 160-V regulator circuit.  This circuit,\\ncomprised of Q3, Q4, R5, C10, and D14, provides over-voltage\\nprotection.  The maximum voltage seen on the output of the\\nregulator is approximately 157 VDC, but under normal operation is\\napproximately 135 VDC.\\nThis voltage is applied to the primary of the self-oscillating\\npower supply.  There an imbalance bias voltage is set through R4\\nthat turns on first Q1.  Feedback windings then provide the\\ncontinual switching for Q1 and Q2 necessary to sustain\\noscillation.\\nOne secondary winding of T1 provides an output that is rectified\\n(by bridge D1, D2, D3, D4) to supply approximately +24.5 VDC and\\n-24.5 VDC to the input of the +15 V and -15 V regulators,\\nrespectively.  The other secondary winding provides an output\\nthat is rectified (by bridge D5, D8) to supply approximately +13\\nVDC to the input of the +5 V regulator.\\nThe output for all the micropac regulators (+15 V, -15 V, +5 V)\\nshould be within 1% of the nominal output voltage.  The inputs to\\nthese regulators are filtered by 82-microfarad caps (C1, C3, C4).\\nThe regulator output is filtered by 1-microfarad caps (C5, C7,\\nC8).\\nThe 1633 EA will draw approximately 85-90 mA from the surface\\npower supply when not connected to the mandrel.\\n*\\nMandrel refers to the 1424 XA or 1421 XA instrument that is\\nrun with the 1633 EA.\\nNOTE:\\nEarly production tools contained additional components to\\nsupport a - 5 Vdc power supply.  These have been removed\\n\\n1633 EA ACOUSTIC ELECTRONICS -- CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Loading checkpoint shards:   0%|          | 0/2 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"abf393861ad84e9e86f348b731085be5"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["     equipment_name                                            topic  \\\n","505  1970IB-SVW-AMO  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE -

A new optics head that provides more optical channels.\\n2. Two new optical channels for methane peak detection, which lie just to the left of the liquid-\\nhydrocarbon peak at Ch_16 and which can be used for estimating Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR).\\n3. A continuous fluid refractive index reading, n, which can be used to monitor sample cleanup and in the\\nClausius Mossotti Ratio, CMR = (n2-1)/(n2+2), which correlates to fluid density.\\n4. A five-channel ultraviolet fluorescence spectrometer, which is indicative of crude oil type.\\nThe brighter and bluer the fluorescence, the lighter the oil.  It can also monitor cleanup.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNM\\n31.7\\u00b0  API\\nCrude #68048\",\n          \"2\\n\\n\\n1970 IB SAMPLE VIEW\\n\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL                                            130949-954 DRAFT\\nOCTOBER 2005\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWARNING:\\nDo NOT look at these LEDs when they are turned on!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey can damage eyes even with brief exposure!\\n\\n\\nAlthough they are BRIGHT, you cannot tell that they are bright because your eyes can only barely\\nsee their light, if at all (bright UV LEDs are used because crude oil fluorescence is weak).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the 1970 IB SampleView is powered with its housing removed:\\n\\n\\n\\nUV Safety Glasses should be worn or cover the chassis with a UV-blocking material\\n\\n\\n\\nPost UV Warning Signs for Any People Passing By.\\n\\n\\nUV Safety Glasses (PN A2001852000) must be available at each base that is running SampleView\\nIB.   These glasses provide 6 powers of ten (a million-fold) reduction in UV light intensity.\\n\\n\\nUV Warning Signs (PN A1000689000) must be posted in areas where the tool might be run with its\\nhousing removed to warn passers by.\\n\\n\\nAn opaque cardboard tube (PN A2001854000) can be slipped over the UV light section of the\\nchassis to cover it.  Alternatively, Kapton film, which is yellow and absorbs UV light, can be draped\\nover the tool when the housing is off to protect people who are nearby.\\n\\n\\nA UV lab safety kit which contains these three items plus a UV light meter (PN A3000526000) has\\nbeen created, but as of the date of release of this manual this kit (PN A5000118000) had not been\\nreleased in SAP.
